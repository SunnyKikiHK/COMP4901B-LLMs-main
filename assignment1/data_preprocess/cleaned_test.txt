You may have been using a car or trunk mounted rack to help tote your toys, like bicycles, on your adventures. Overtime, you may have found that you are carrying more equipment. For example, you may have tire pumps, replacement tires and other tools. If this sounds like your current situation, then you may be considering a toy hauler purchase. Before you go out and buy one that looks like it may work for you, consider these three things to look for in the ideal toy hauler for your mountain bike adventurers. Injection moulding is an ideal process for manufacturing plastic parts and products. In general, this method allows the creation of custom polymer items through the placement of molten resin is a pre-manufactured mould. Therefore, you will enjoy exceptional fabrication versatility and high-quality production. Unfortunately, the cost of the injection moulding process can be considerably high. If you are concerned about the financial impact of your plastic manufacturing project, you should think about using the below-outlined guidelines to reduce your expenses. Are you shopping for plastic bottles that you can use to package your products? Read on and discover the attributes of some of the common resins from which plastic bottles are made. Use this information to select the most appropriate type of bottle for your application. Some plastic bottles are made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These bottles are transparent and have high resistance to oils. They are flexible and can block most gases from penetrating into the contents of the bottle. If you are looking to purchase athletic goalposts, it is important for you to evaluate the different products in the market. This will help you identify the best features for your potential personal or commercial application. In addition, goalposts are not similar in quality, so careful assessment during the selection process will allow you to find the most suitable and durable items. Here is a brief description of the main factors that you should consider before buying athletic goalposts. Some components that have been fabricated using water jet cutting can have striations that may serve as lines of weakness from which early metal fatigue can start in the fabricated components. This reduced fatigue life can cause premature failure of components. This article discusses some of the measures that metal fabricators can implement in order to ensure that your products will have an increased fatigue resistance after water jet cutting has been performed on them. Welcome to my blog. My name is Mark, and as the father of three sons, I have coached a lot of youth sports over the years. I have also bought a lot of trophies, and that inspired me to learn everything I could about trophies. To help other parents and coaches, I have started a blog about trophies, but I work in manufacturing so I may post some general industry and manufacturing blogs as well.  I thank you for reading. This is my first attempt at making a blog, and I sincerely hope that it helps and inspires you. If you like my posts, you can share them with your friends.

See Also: GILT-GLOSS 5512 SUBMARINER Click on dates below to view the dials from each time period: 1959-1960 1961-1962 1964-1965 The 1950s to the mid 1960s was a golden era for Rolex. Watches produced by the company during this time have captivated the hearts and minds of Rolex collectors for many years. The passion that drives many watch collectors is the desire to find not just older watches, but to search for vintage watches whose dials have been well preserved and protected from the elements and at the same time, have aged in a way that each has taken on a unique patina. Thanks to the introduction by Rolex of it’s patented Oyster case with its improved screw down case back and winding crown, many of these dials have survived today giving collectors much to be happy about. The dials produced for the Rolex Submariner and GMT during this time are known by collectors as gilt-gloss or gilt/gloss dials. The term gilt, as applied to these early Rolex dials, refers to both the gold tone of the text as well as other features of the dial. While many collectors may not feel that the term gilt is appropriate when used in this context, it has stood the test of time, and as any collector with a passion for Rolex dials can tell you, it is a far better description than the names given to identify some other dials. The term gloss describes the mirror like black glossy surface of these dials, which is in contrast to the matte finish which was introduced by dial manufacturers for Rolex watches in the mid 1960s (two pictures below courtesy of Tomvox). The manner in which these gilt-gloss dials were produced is very interesting. While some dial manufacturers might paint the text on the colored surface of the dial, those making the dials for the Rolex Submariner and the GMT did so in a way that the gold colored text and features are in relief or below the surface instead of on top. These gold aspects of the dial are actually the brass dial plate and lie underneath a coat of black glossy paint. On top of the black layer of paint, a clear coat of lacquer was then applied . In the case of the very early gilt-gloss dials, it was not uncommon to have lines of silver colored text in addition to the gold colored text. The silver colored text was applied on top of the final clear lacquer coat. Finally, the luminous material that allowed the watch to be read in the dark was applied. The more radioactive radium used for the dial and hands in the 1950s to make them glow was swapped for the less radioactive tritium in the early 1960s. The way these dials have aged is at the heart of why these watches are so favored by vintage Rolex collectors. Just as no two fingerprints are the same, the same can be said of these early Rolex dials. It is not uncommon for the dials produced in the 1950s to have a darker more orange color to the text on the dial, while many others that were produced later tend to have acquired more lighter shades of gold tone. The difference between the two is likely due to the radium versus tritium used for the luminous material and how the brass dial plate reacted with the chemicals used to prevent corrosion during the manufacturing process. Another beautiful feature of these rare watches is the appearance of the glossy dial in different lighting conditions. The richness of the black high gloss finish of many dials can be readily seen in the sunlight, while other dials exhibit different shades of brown. Another reason these early Rolex models are sought after by enthusiasts is because of the attractive styling of the watch case. As hobbies evolve and collectors become more knowledgeable, it’s common for the emphasis placed on certain aspects of the objects collected to change over time. Vintage watch collecting is no exception. Within the last five or six years, collectors have moved away from the mantra, “It’s all about the dial” and adopted a more progressive maxim, “A great watch starts with a great dial, but doesn’t end there”. Both the Rolex Submariner reference 5512 and its predecessor, the Submariner 6538, share the large chamfers or beveled edge on the lugs of the watch case that are prized by collectors. In recent years collectors have realized that unmolested examples with their sharp cases nearly intact are rare treasures. The Rolex Submariner reference 5512 was introduced in 1959 and was likely produced until 1980. Early examples were fitted with the calibre 1530 movement, and the improved chronometer rated 1560 movement was introduced a year or so later. The 5512 shared some of the styling features of the earlier Submariners like the outer rotating black bezel that helps to keep track of elapsed time. However, unlike the earlier Submariners, the watch case produced for the 5512 featured crown guards on either side of the winding crown, a feature that remains on the Submariner to this day. The many different gilt-gloss dials combined with the different shaped crown guards are some of the unique features of the 5512 that make this sporty and elegant reference a favorite of vintage Rolex collectors. Understanding the chronology and significance of these early dials is a passion of mine. From a collector's perspective it is important to be able to evaluate a vintage watch based on its originality and period correctness. Unfortunately, not many collectors have the ability to locate vintage watches from original owners, and because the provenance of other watches is not always clear, understanding the significant changes in the evolution of this Submariner is critical in making sure that the watch has the correct movement and dial. The following is a brief overview of the 5512 discussing some of the more common and rare gilt-gloss dials and their characteristics as well as a short summary of the different types of crown guards and movements from 1959 to 1966. There are few hard and concrete rules with Rolex during this period, and as such, this overview should NOT be seen as a conclusive authority to check the correctness of your vintage Rolex, but rather a guide to help collectors appreciate the many subtle nuances of the 5512 from the early to mid 60's. A warm thank you to Andrew Shear for allowing the pictures from his dial archive for this 5512 review.

> > Poetry Northwest  (1959) V. The Wisdom of a Poor Man               to a tree, and sat down to eat his midday 1 meal.               tree. "               Do not fasten your horse to that tree," cried the poor man. " My               horse is very savage.4 He will kill yours. Fasten him to another               tree." The rich man answered proudly, "I shall tie my horse where               I wish." 5 So he fastened his horse to the same tree to which the poor man's               horse was tied, and sat down to eat his dinner. Suddenly 6 the men heard a great noise, and looked up. Their               horses were fighting. The two men rushed up 7 to stop them, but               too late. The rich man's horse was dead. "                See what your horse has done! " he cried to the poor man in               great anger. " But you shall pay 8for it ! You shall pay for               it ! " So saying, he dragged 9 the poor man before the judge.10 "                O wise 11 judge !" he cried. " This man's savage horse               has killed my horse-my beautiful, kind, gentle,4 horse ! Make him               pay for it or send him to prison,12 I beg of you." The judge turned to the poor man. "Did your horse kill this               man's horse i" he asked. But the poor man said not one word.13 "                Can't you talk 4" asked the judge. The poor man answered never a word. The judge asked the poor man many questions, but he still kept               his lips closed 14 and answered nothing. At last the judge said to the rich man: " What can I do'!               This poor man is dumb. He cannot speak a word." "                Oh, sir," said the rich man, "he can talk as well as               you or I. He spoke to me on the road." "               Are you sure?" asked the judge. "What did he say!" " Indeed, I am sure. He said quite plainly 15: ` Do not fasten               your horse to that tree. My horse is very savage. He will kill               yours. Fasten him to another tree."' ` Ah," said the judge, "  now I see. If he warned               16 you, he need not pay for your horse.17 You only are to blame.18               You should have heeded 19 his warning 16." Then the judge turned to the poor man. " Why did you not answer               my questions?" he asked. "               Can you not seo,20 O wise judge?" answered the poor man. "If               I had told you that I warned him not to tie his horse near mine,               he would have denied 21 it. Then you would not know which of us               was telling the truth. I knew, 0 wise one, that if I let him tell               the story alone, you would soon learn the truth." The poor man's words pleased the judge, and he sent the rich man               away without a penny. But he praised Is the poor man for his wisdom. --- 1 At twelve o'clock, in the middle of the day, at midday; opp,               midnight. 2 Or: fastened, made fast, by means of a rope (which               is like a string, but much thicker and stronger). 3 Or: began.               4 It is not a quiet horse, it bites ; opp. gentle. b Or: where               I like, where it pleases me.6 Or : all at once. 7 Or : hurried               towards them, ran up to them. 8 Or : suffer. 9 opp. to take gently.

" This man's savage horse               has stop ed my horse-my beautiful, kind, gentle,4 horse ! Make him               pay for it or send him to prison,12 I beg of you."                what is judge turned to what is poor man. "Did your horse stop  this               man's horse i" he asked.                But what is poor man said not one word.13                "                Can't you talk 4" asked what is judge.                what is poor man answered never a word.                what is judge asked what is poor man many questions, but he still kept               his lips closed 14 and answered nothing.                At last what is judge said to what is rich man: " What can I do'!               This poor man is dumb. He cannot speak a word."                "                Oh, sir," said what is rich man, "he can talk as well as               you or I. He spoke to me on what is road."                "               Are you sure?" asked what is judge. "What did he say!"                " Indeed, I am sure. He said quite plainly 15: ` Do not fasten               your horse to that tree. My horse is very savage. He will stop                yours. Fasten him to another tree."'                ` Ah," said what is judge, "  now I see. If he warned               16 you, he need not pay for your horse.17 You only are to blame.18               You should have heeded 19 his warning 16."                Then what is judge turned to what is poor man. " Why did you not answer               my questions?" he asked.                "               Can you not seo,20 O wise judge?" answered what is poor man. "If               I had told you that I warned him not to tie his horse near mine,               he would have denied 21 it. Then you would not know which of us               was telling what is truth. I knew, 0 wise one, that if I let him tell               what is story alone, you would soon learn what is truth."                what is poor man's words pleased what is judge, and he sent what is rich man               away without a penny. But he praised Is what is poor man for his wisdom.                              ---                1 At twelve o'clock, in what is middle of what is day, at midday; opp,               midnight. 2 Or: fastened, made fast, by means of a rope (which               is like a string, but much thicker and stronger). 3 Or: began.               4 It is not a quiet horse, it bites ; opp. gentle. b Or: where               I like, where it pleases me.6 Or : all at once. 7 Or : hurried               towards them, ran up to them. 8 Or : suffer. 9 opp. to take gently.

It was named for its position precisely in the very centre of Empedrado Street, very close to the Cathedral Plaza (Plaza de la Catedral).  One of the journalists thought to write up his name on a wall and that is how a tradition started out that persists to this day. Among the many names that figure on the walls, are Pablo Neruda, Agustín Lara, Brigitte Bardot, Ignacio Villa (Bola de Nieve), Ernest Hemingway and Salvador Allende. It is an ideal spot to enjoy typical Cuban cuisine based on rice, black beans, fried plantains, roasted pork and jerked beef in tomato sauce (tasajo entomatado), as well as the traditional mandioca (yuca).

Question for the 737-100 gurus; Any US operators flew the 100 with the original engine configuration? Or, who all other than Lufthansa flew the 100 with the original engines? Posts: 311 Location: Melbourne Beach, FL Occupation: International Man of Mystery Age: 45 Post # , posted on 03-04-2017 GMT-5 hours Hi Walter, The -100 aircraft adorned with the original (ineffective) thrust reverser design were delivered new to DLH, Avianca, and Malaysia/Singapore Airlines. The two Avianca jets were removed from the fleet quickly due to a lack of "hot and high" airport performance, and eventually flew with Aloha. The first of these aircraft came back in 1973, so I would think that the Rohr conversion would've been accomplished by then.  So, I don't think any US domestic airlines used the -100 with those reversers. That being said, lots of US airlines used the -200 in that configuration such as UAL, Piedmont, Air California, and PSA to name few.  I hope that helps.

Or, who all other than Lufthansa flew the 100 with the original engines? Go back to the first page and see my profile of N9002U - she flew for some months with the short nacelles, and as Dan noted, so did a number of others.  That was the factory standard until sometime in late 1968 (May '69 rings a bell - Dan?) when the extended pipes got FAA approval.  All short pipe airplanes were quickly retrofitted in the name of safety.  It's kind of a b***h when the main wheels get lifted off the runway when you're trying to slow down! Great job Kurt.  That's a gorgeous model!

I don't know if it ever went into service in that configuration. Oops, just reread the question. N734N was a -200! Posts: 311 Location: Melbourne Beach, FL Occupation: International Man of Mystery Age: 45 Post # , posted on 03-05-2017 GMT-5 hours Hello, Very close...the first 737 to leave the factory with the Rohr reverser was a United 737-222 (sn 19933, ln 135) on January 3, 1969.  Every previous 737 was retrofitted soon thereafter.  The 737 went from having the worst reverser to having one that was very effective.  Boeing test pilots used to take the Rohr modded airplanes to Boardman's 4,000 ft runway and demonstrate landings to a full stop with just the reversers and no wheel brakes!  They were that good!  Cool history!

A real beauty. I really like the subtle weathering on the wings. Whats more is AA has provided us with a plethora of kits and window decals to recreate these Airliners. Posts: 724 Location: Ratingen Occupation: retired airline pilot Age: Post # , posted on 03-06-2017 GMT-5 hours Thank you all for your nice comments. The coroguard is from the local hard ware store and probably not available worldwide. It comes in a rattle can  and is applied to a clear decal sheet and then cut into size. This technique works really good. You should give a try to various silver paints from your hard ware or automotive store. Posts: 1084 Location: Stratford, CT. Occupation: Police Officer (retired) Age: 62 Post # , posted on 03-06-2017 GMT-5 hours We recently found out an interesting detail on the Piedmont 737 used in the pre-delivery photo session. There were 2 different size Piedmont logos used on the R-side & L-side rear cheatlines. When the A/C was delivered Piedmont decided to delete them altogether in-service! Posts: 13 Location: Occupation: Aviation illustrator and designer Age: Post # , posted on 03-07-2017 GMT-5 hours Beautiful model but... is it me or does the Coroguard stop short from reaching the wingtips on the ref photos? Looks like the wingtip is mainly natural metal! Posts: 881 Location: south of FRA close to RWY 18 Occupation: window seat or aisle seat? Age: 51 Post # , posted on 03-07-2017 GMT-5 hours The discussion continues... Some call it discussion (that's why we have a forum) others call it arguing... Anyway, I love it.... Without wanting to contradict anybody. I would say it's hard to say. but finally: We can't be absolute certain about those minor details. And...is it really so important? the tips might be natural metal. But could be also light reflections. Depending on photo, light conditions etc. sometimes it's really hard to distinguish. For comparison: Look at J's prototype photo. while the starboard wingtip looks light (BAC?) grey. As long we have no 100% certain evidence - so what? Who cares? Might be - might be not. Who had ever seen an early 737-130 and can remember for sure under oath? Kurt, leave it as it is! It's a magnificent model! Ultimately, you decide for yourself! My opinion only. Others of course welcome. I'm not sensitive. P.S.: found that on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DdoWJJL9Xw Very interesting! 4 parts. Some of you may already know that video. Posts: 13 Location: Occupation: Aviation illustrator and designer Age: Post # , posted on 03-08-2017 GMT-5 hours @ the PRIDEbird.... not sure why you are implying I'm arguing, that's a very emotive thing to say, me thinks maybe you want an argument. I was merely pointing out what was obvious to me. I'm 100% certain the Coroguard stops short of the wingtip in the photos and as a major part of this thread was about accuracy I added some useful information to the conversation, not argument as you imply. If people think its important to them then its important to them, so long as the builder is happy then as you point out who cares. But, and there is always a but....  if Kurt is aiming for as an accurate as possible model then it looks like, from the ref, there is a mistake but then as we don't see the actual aircraft wingtip in question of 'ED we will never know. I don't actually care as the model looks stunning as is. When I build models accuracy isn't that important so long as it looks right but in my work as an illustrator it's vitally important and yes I do get it wrong and having had a lot of work published in magazines such as Airliner World I'm gutted when someone points out a mistake but I'd rather it be pointed out (politely) than ignored or you make the same mistake again and again, sometimes you can't see the wood for the trees. Anyways I find your aggressive tone quite baffling but as you say you're not sensitive! Oh crap I just realised I took your bait. ;-) Posts: 506 Location: Haarlem Occupation: Procrastinator Age: 27 Post # , posted on 03-08-2017 GMT-5 hours Very very inspiring model Kurt. The paneling on the wings look great, not something we see anymore on the newer planes. Any chance you'll release the engines as an accessories set to pimp my Eastern 737-100 kit? Or would that be bad for the sales on your complete kit? (which I'd understand, but you also did the -200Adv. engines). @Sven: At first glance at your comment I thought you wrote a poem Posts: 881 Location: south of FRA close to RWY 18 Occupation: window seat or aisle seat? Age: 51 Post # , posted on 03-08-2017 GMT-5 hours @airlinerart1: NOT YOU ARGUING!!!! In this thread I told my opinion. I was accused I'm arguing instead of discussing. Maybe some people can't accept other view of points or contradictions and feel it as a personal attack. That is unfortunate but c'est la vie! A simple tit-for-tat response. Nothing more to say about it - leave it as it is. Yeah I'm total agree with you. It seems the coroguard stops before the wigtip. It's a very small and easy adjustment and Kurt could modify it without problems. I should rather point out the problem of photos. @TheFlyingDutchman: "Once in a Galaxy far far away..." See the things loose! Posts: 881 Location: south of FRA close to RWY 18 Occupation: window seat or aisle seat? Age: 51 Post # , posted on 03-08-2017 GMT-5 hours Oh my God! I believe here there are many misunderstandings! I can't leave it as it is. I try to clarify the situation in english words as good as I can. Step 1: Kurt hasn't finished his wonderful "Flensburg" yet and Great-J. first reaction was a negative review. Nothing positive like: "Nice done.." "Very nice work.." etc. something like that. Not a single nice word. Almost like a sledge hammer. Kurt is so an accurate model builder and he made it with all his effort! J's words "I hate to be the bearer of potentially bad news, but..." sounds to me like "I hate to be the bearer of potentially bad news, but...I want to be!" That's why I made my response (see above). So that was actually done for me at that point. Sorry J, maybe I expected to much! Sorry if you are miffed. Never my intention. I was not concerned about whether he was right or not, I was rather annoyed about it, which he immediately criticized. That's okay but I didn't liked it. Can't remember J ever said a good word about a built model. Oh my God J! I don't wanna touch you! Maybe I'm wrong (I hope so) maybe I just missed it! I don't want arguing - I want discussing. Step 2: Was Steve's reaction who said I didn't read the thread. The avalanche has broken loose. He said J is just trying to help. Of course! Everyone is trying to help. And that's right! Everyone knows something what another may don't know. We all help each other! I referred to the photos. Look, things of the past which are gone forever or which became rare today we often have no 100% evidence how they looked like in real. Sometimes we have few photos (depending on quality) in worst case we have nothing except memories. It's a bit like dinosaurs. Scientifics have fossiles to help for reconstruction. But they can't say for sure about details. They can't say a T-Rex had a blue feather dress. No one has ever seen a T-Rex and so we have no 100% evidence. And as long we have no 100% evidence and no proof of the opposite everything is possible. Okay the 737-130 isn't a dinosaur (maybe figuratively) and not 65 mio. years ago. All we have are a few photos and memories. A bit fantasy and maybe not absolute 100% accuracy. you as an illustrator should know it best. You may take a look in various books (or google in the net) for a specific dinosaur and you will see how complete different they look like. The example dinosaurs is just a comparison here in that case. That's what I tried to say all the time. I cooled down the emotions and the file is closed. It's not always easy to say in a different language. Posts: 82 Location: Any cockpit will do Occupation: Age: 115 Post # , posted on 03-08-2017 GMT-5 hours gavmh : The model is now finished.

I must admit I agree with you Pbird on one thing, I do know best and thanks for correcting yourself and agreeing I was 100% right regarding the Coroguard, takes a big man to admit they were wrong!

Disciple Fast Track “Into the Word Into the World” is an adaptation of the original, bestselling Disciple Bible Study Into the Word Into the World. The study is ideal for busy people who want to fit an in-depth Bible study into their schedule. The study retains the familiar Disciple format with its theme word, theme verse, statement of the human condition, daily and weekly assignments, and prayer. Into the Word helps readers deepen their understanding of Scripture and make connections between what they already know and what they are reading. Each week you will encounter three spiritual disciplines, learn what they are, and how you can engage those disciplines. The first discipline varies from week to week, then moves into Sabbath and prayer. In every session, you commit to how you will respond to Scripture in terms of ministry in the world. Into the World identifies some needs in the world for which ministry is needed and suggests possible responses, then invites participants to summarize the scripture message that will shape their ministry and to decide what response and commitment to make to that message. Each week you will be guided in experiencing the gift of Sabbath rest and renewal. Classes meet for a total of 24 weeks, studying Genesis-Exodus and Luke–Acts for 12 sessions each. Daily preparation is manageable, with 3–5 chapters of the Bible to read each day. 8:30am, April 22nd, 2018 Women's Bible Study 5:00pm, April 22nd, 2018 6:00pm, April 22nd, 2018

The main cause has been rising food prices, in turn propelled by the drought and the rapid devaluation of the Metical. There are now 5.46 MT to 1 Rand and 77.9 MT to 1 US dollar, compared to 2.68 and 44.62 in January. But in the past two months, devaluation has been only 1% against the Rand and 8% against the dollar. but will cut overtime payments, although not of doctors and teachers, Economy and Finance Minister Adriano Maleiane said Friday. He also left unclear whether government would pay the traditional 13th month salary at the end of the year. However, in a meeting with President Nyusi 12 October, teachers said that the overtime had already been cut. (O Pais 13, 17 Oct) Because of budget restrictions, the Ministry of Education has not been able to hire enough teachers, and schools are dependent on teachers doing extra hours covering classes without teachers. $900 mn not additional debt . Economy and Finance Minister Adriano Maleiane has denied that the $900 mn in arms loans revealed two weeks ago by (AC) is a new debt - and that is correct. The article was badly edited to say "another US$900 million of secret" loans and had a misleading headline claiming "more secret debts", but on close reading does not claim this is new debt. Instead it is an explanation of part of the $2.2 bn in secret loans which had not previously been identified. What claims is that the three SISE and Ematum companies took almost half of the money they borrowed and then lent it on to companies linked to the Frelimo elite who used it to buy weapons and pay commissions. So these are new loans, but relending money already included in the $2.2 bn, so not additional debt. Over 1,200 workers have lost their jobs in Nampula province because of the closure of 30 companies due to the economic crisis, according to Mozambique’s main trade union federation, the OTM (Mozambican Workers’ Organization). (AIM En 13 Oct) according to Boaventura Sibindy, the General Secretary of the Union of Workers of Private Security Companies. There are 102 private security companies with 52,000 workers, but 2,300 have lost their jobs in the past year, and in Sofala, Zambezia, Nampula and Niassa there are serious wage arrears, in part because government is not paying the companies. Some dismissed workers cannot claim unemployment benefits because the companies robbed them by deducting social security contributions from their wages, but then failing to pass the money on to the National Social Security Institute (INSS). (AIM En 8 Oct) Two bridges in Zambezia cut in the floods earlier this year cannot be repaired because of lack of money, according to provincial public works director Artur Graciano. The bridge over the river Malei, near Maganja da Costa, will cost $25-30 mn to rebuild. The other bridge is over the Licungo River near Mocuba. ( 10 Oct) Mozambique Finance Minister Signed 'Secret' Loans - Report Finance Minister Signed 'Secret' Loan Guarantees Audit of Undisclosed Loans Will Be Public, Says IMF How Close are Govt and IMF on the Audit? Govt Accepts International Audit, Says IMF No Tug of War With IMF, Says Nyusi Govt Committed to Cooperation With U.S But it is not simply lack of money, it is allocation of funds. The Maputo-KaTembe suspension bridge will be a dramatic landmark, but it comes with a high price tag - two loans from the Export-Import Bank of China totalling $754 million. A more modest but totally adequate bridge could have been built for one-third of the cost. This would have released $500 mn for bridges and roads elsewhere. A choice was made, and bridges are not being repaired in the rest of the country so that Maputo and President Guebuza can have a landmark bridge. Similarly the Bank of Mozambique headquarters in Maputo will cost $230 mn instead of the $90 mn planned; this represents a choice of one investment over others.

Samora Machel was killed 30 years ago, 19 October 1986, in a still unexplained plane crash in Mbuzine, South Africa. and severely injured Friday on Kenneth Kaunda Avenue, Maputo, in front of the US embassy. He is the brother of Momad Khalib Ayoob who was murdered in April 2012 outside a Maputo mosque. Khalib Ayoob had been arrested at Matsapha airport, Swaziland, in December 2010 with $2.7 million in banknotes; he exported the money illegally from Mozambique and said he was taking it to Dubai. The money was confiscated by the Swazi authorities. Khalib Ayoob’s widow, Reyma Ayoob was kidnapped in October 2014, and spent 22 days in captivity before she was released on payment of a ransom. In April 2014, one of his sons, Bilal Ayoob, was kidnapped, held captive for 10 days, and released when the family paid an unspecified ransom into a bank account in an Asian country. In August 2012, Ayoob's 17 year old niece, Hina Farouk Ayoob, was abducted. The Ayoob family owns several companies, one of which, Niza Lda, achieved notoriety in 2010 when the Mozambican Tax Authority ordered the public sale of its goods to pay off a debt of 276 million meticais (then $8 million) to the mobile phone company M-Cel. Niza had been selling M-Cel pre-paid phone cards but failed to pay M-Cel. (AIM En 14 Oct) by the government on 12 October.

Drought will continue in the far south, Maputo province and southern Gaza. The centre of the country plus southern and western Nampula province and southern Niassa are expected to have above average rainfall, with possible flooding. But northern Niassa, Cabo Delgado and coastal areas of Nampula are predicted to have average or below average rainfall. (AIM Pt 7 Oct) is slowly moving closer. It has been a dream since the colonial era, as Tete has high quality iron ore plus coal, electricity and water. Baobab Resources has access to the iron ore and is mostly owned by private equity group African Minerals Exploration & Development Funds and 13% owned by the World Bank's International Finance Corporation.

Bible Chapter Topic List (just a few) Bible Numeric's The Bible's Number Symbolism in History Martin Luther's posting the thesis on the door           in 1517 lines up with Deu 15:17 Does God Judge Nations? 911 -- Is the number 911  found in the Bible Verses with 9:11 type chapter and Solomon's Evil and 911 Israel's six day war - Jerusalem returned to the Jews on June 7, 1967         Pattern and Numbers of the Numeric Map involved. This is a grandiose         statement to make and the subject for a future publication, but it is         worth mentioning here so you will be on the lookout for them.         Posted the 95 Thesis on the Church Door (Reformation Day, Oct 31st) Deu 15:17 then , and he shall be your servant forever. Also you shall do likewise       to your maidservant. Notice how the text of this verse with reference of 15:17 seems to match         with the historical event that took place in the year 1517.... Reformation Day is the Christian holiday we celebrate Martin Luther's act of reformation - it is commonly celebrated on the 31st of October of every year but there are disputes as to the actual day of this act of Luther in posting the 95 thesis. I believe it is no coincidence that many celebrate Halloween on this same day and suspect it is a way to distract from this amazing Christian date in history. It seems very similar to how December 25th-Christmas, the celebration of the appearance of Jesus on earth (not necessarily the day of his birth) is claimed by many to be the improper date to celebrate. There are many evidences in the Bible strongly suggesting #25 is associated with many appearances of the Lord. The primary of these evidences is the 25,000th verse of the Bible where baby Jesus is first presented publically as the messiah at the temple. See the verses beginning at Luke 2:25(25)-26, 27 - Luke 2:26 is the 25,000th verse. The 2500th verse also points to an appearance of the Lord on earth--Exodus 34:3-8 encompasses this event of Moses going before the Lord who appeared to him (34:3 is the 2500th verse). Matthew 1:25 speaks of Jesus birth and Matthew chapter 25 is about the coming of the Bridegroom - Jesus. God is in control of this world more than we can possibly imagine and I suspect he causes some things to be that we thought are the work of men. I believe October 31st is the true Reformation Day, December 25th is God's intended day for celebrating his appearance; and that numbers throughout the Bible are of his creation, not ours. This verse at Deuteronomy 15:17  is evidence the Bible contains numbers corresponding to dates in         history. Although not proof, it is very interesting. This noteworthy         verse in Deuteronomy tells of a seemingly strange custom, but when we         history, we can get a glimpse of a  reason the text was worded in the sort of strange  way it         was. God so often hides deep meanings in his word just below the surface of the text so he may reveal it to the diligent - when he decides it is time to do so. In this verse, the word         "ear" used in the original translation may also be associated         with posting a "notice". It would make sense this scripture         is  saying   the servant who desires to be a bondservant        is to post a notice on the door of the ownwer's house so others may be fully aware he  is now a bondservant of his own will.  Although this verse seems prophetic,  it is not worded as a statement of prophecy. The text         appears intentionally phrased to catch our attention so  one day we might realize this passage's chapter and verse reference are not         accidental. God wanted us to one day  know he  deliberately         numbered chapter and verses to perfection to prove without doubt he is the author of the Bible. -top-   earthquake in Haiti? Is it possible that  the events such as September 11th, 2001 in the United   States; the Indian ocean   earthquake and tsunami of Dec 26, 2004; or the recent earthquake in Haiti on   January 13, 2010 , were judgments of God? Only God can say for sure, but   maybe a better question is, does God judge nations for their sin or even, does   God judge while we are here on earth, or is  judgment postponed until we reach   heaven or enter eternal life? The Bible has lots of examples of judgments of   associated with the Bible's theme for number 911.   for yourself if God might be behind some of the world's great catastrophes. It   both shows biblical examples of God's judgment on nations as well as how it   might relate to 911...only God knows for sure. Is 911 in the Bible?          -- 911 seems a  number related         to the judgment of nations... First, to begin with, I don't claim to know God's intentions and           associated with the themes for 911 that I find in the scriptures. Each           person must decide for themselves what this all means. I present this           information for those who ask if 911 is found in the Bible -  I think         it is... (see also definition for #19 which is related to #911). One of the best         examples of numbers in our world and history is the date September 11,2001 which         we now commonly refer to as 911. Some of us also know 911 is the telephone         number we enter to quickly get emergency help. Could God be behind the         number 911? Scripture seems to say so. This is what I believe to be the Bible's best reference to 911 and the         first one I discovered. Daniel 9:11 is the 22,000th verse of the Bible         and 22 is one of the strongest numbers associated with him. The 31 verses         to notice this reference to 911 when studying them one day. God's number 911 is related             to God's wrath and dealing with nations             turned from him. It is important to differentiate that 911 appears .             the Bible's 911 verses. The number 911 is made up of the foundational             Lord's return, and eleven which is a number of warning. 911 fits             it up. Positive 911 vs negative 911:         those saved upon the Lord's return, but it seems to appear more often             in reference to consequences to nations.  911 is             including and very often related to that catching up of God's people         prior to Jesus return. 911 related Bible verses seem more consistently         events happening just prior to the return of the Lord.         about all these number relationships and to add a bit to the complexity, all         the numbers - 911, 119, 29, and 92 are related to         is the last number before 100 -  a number of totality or things         coming to an end. The best example of this relationship of         99 (and 999) to events before the end is the 23,999th verse of the Bible.         return of the Lord and happens to contain the 24,000th Bible verse referring         specifically to this future event. The two verses leading up to this         24,000th verse seem very clearly to point to the catching up of the believers         prior to Jesus return (Rapture?). Notice how the 23,999th verse speaks         of those caught up and the 24,000th speaks of the Lord's return. Again,         relationship between 911 and things coming to an end: 23,998 - Matt 24:40 "Then there will         be two men in the field; . 23, - Matt 24:41 "Two women will be         grinding at the mill; . 24,000 - Matt 24:42 "Therefore , for . If this all seems a bit unbelievable, consider that the         same pattern found in the 30,998th through 31,000th Bible verses. Note         to as the rapture event. Consider also how the 998th and 999th verse         statement is a reference to calling believers out just before the 31,000th         which refers to the consequences about to take place: 30, 8 - Rev 18:4 I      heard another voice from heaven, saying, "         out of her, my people, so that you will not participate in her sins and ; 30, - Rev 18:5 for her sins have piled up as high as heaven, and God         has remembered her iniquities. 1,000 - Rev 18:6 "         even as she has paid, and give back to her double according to her deeds ; in the       cup which she has mixed, mix twice as much for her. -top- 911--The 911th   Chapter-Haggai 2-The Lord Will  Shake the Heavens It seems logical that three Bible chapters in sequence might tell of Jesus return, but we don't notice this progressive sequence of chapter events when they cross book boundaries. When we understand the meaningful nature of the Bible's numbering, (in this case the cross Bible chapter numbers), we can use the guide of themes for these numbers to understand their contents. Bible chapter numbers help us see that Haggai chapter 2 followed by Zechariah chapters 1 and 2 are three successive chapters that give a picture of events leading up to, and following Jesus second return. The 911th, 912th and the 913th chapter of the Bible appear to foretell the return of the Lord. Haggai 2, the 911th Bible chapter is the warning of his imminent return; the next and 912th chapter gives the vision of his actual return; and the following 913th chapter reveals the Lord on earth ready to take his first action of measuring Jerusalem. These three chapters and the ones surrounding them seem to be an agenda of events regarding the very last days. The 911th chapter: Stern warnings of the Lord's return - "in a little while" The following verses from Haggai chapter 2 help demonstrate how the chapter is about warning of the Lord's return. The phrase "in a little while" tells us it is about something yet to happen and may even be an indication of when (see note below). "For thus says the LORD of hosts, 'Once more , , the sea also and the dry land. v7 'I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,' says the LORD of hosts. Haggai 2:6-7 The closing verse of the chapter at 2:23 specifically mentions "that day" in reference to the day of the Lord helps us confirm the #911 related theme. (other Numeric Map related numbers also help confirm the theme) . Normally we would not notice a sequence of events in successive chapters crossing book boundaries, but when you begin to understand the Bible's perfect structure through the numeric map, you will see the Bible as a single volume with 1189 chapters which is separated into book-like sections. So, of the chapters are successive,  it would not be sprirising to find the next chapter telling of Jesus actual return - and that's exactly what we find in Zechariah chapter 1. The 912th chapter: the vision of Jesus actual second return Note, the phrase "a little while" found in Haggai 2:6 happens to occur in 29 Bible verses which is more support for the theme of the numbers #911, #29 and #92. These 29 verses appear to all be related to the theme of #29 about the return of the Lord and can be separated into two categories related to timeframes of the first and second coming of Jesus - the time Jesus is on earth prior to his ascension, and the time until his return. see definition for number #29 on web site for more about this . We know in the last chapter of Haggai we read about the warnings of the Lord's, and now in Zechariah 1, the 912th chapter we read about his actual return - the vision of Jesus actually touching down on earth which is commonly called the second return of the Lord. Following is a conversation with Jesus from that chapter that shows this is a vision of real conversation between the Lord and Zechariah on earth. I would not read this as if it were a dream but rather as a real vision from God - as if God played a movie for him. Zech 1:8 I saw at night, and behold, a man was riding on a red horse, and he was standing among the myrtle trees which were in the ravine, with red, sorrel and white horses behind him. Zech 1:10 and said, "These are those whom the LORD has sent to patrol the earth."       913th chapter: Jesus first actions upon touching down to earth The next chapter in sequence is Zechariah 2, the 913th chapter which shows Jesus beginning to take his first action promised upon his return. Here are the first verses of this chapter that tell of Jesus going out to perform his first task: Zech 2:1 Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold, there was a man with a measuring line in his hand. Zech 2:2 So I said, " Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem , to see how wide it is and how long it is." Zech 2:3 And behold, the angel who was speaking with me was going out , and another angel was coming out to meet him, Beginning with chapter #911 which is the last chapter of Haggai, these three successive chapters help confirm the 911th chapter is actually about the warnings of Jesus imminent second return that will begin with a shaking of the heavens. I suspect we are seeing many of these warnings in our world today - which seem to indicate his second coming is very near. -top-   with 9:11 type chapter and verse references         theme of 911. These are 12 of 37 Bible verses with a reference of 9:11         and represent the best examples of the number theme relationship.  If         you example all the 9:11 verses you will find a very similar, but more         subtle allusion to this theme. If you have the normal skepticism that         these are conveniently selected examples to fit my premise, take a few         moments to truly ponder how 1/3rd of the 9:11 verses have such a strikingly         similar theme. This examples of of the 9:11 themes along with so many         all be coincidence. I devote  a section of         more about them. Dan 9:11 "Indeed all Israel has transgressed Your law and   turned aside, not obeying Your voice; so the curse has been poured out on us,   along with the oath which is written in the law of Moses the servant of God,   for we have sinned against Him. (The 22,000th verse speaks of God cursing Israel   because, as a nation, they have turned from him. Read on in your Bible and   you will find consequences are in store because of this sin of their nation.) 9:11 As for Ephraim, ... 9:11 " ,... 9:11 "... ,... 9:11 "You divided the sea before   them, ... .... 9:11 They have as king over them, the angel   of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon... 9:11 "   of ruins, A haunt of jackals ;... 9:11 ...... the uncleanness of the peoples...their ...filled it from end to end with their impurity. 9:11 '...   it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs . 9:11 ... ...And spurs   their enemies on, 9:11 ..."   is it that the scribes say that Elijah must come first? " 9:11 , ...         to times and activities of the last days. Following is a list of all         37 books that contain a 9:11 verse should you want to investigate others.         The underlined books are the ones represented in the above examples: Solomon's Evil and The Bible has 31,102 verses and amazingly, the themes implied in the         text of their verses. As         unbelievable as this perfection seems, you         find compelling evidence in verse examples such as the 24,000th verse         mentioned earlier.         We all know there are 24 hours in a day and this verse in Matthew 24;         is in a chapter about the coming DAY of the Lord; also points to a key         to be on the alert for this specific DAY; as well as having a verse         24. The random possibility of all these five strong references to the         number 24 landing on this unique 24,000th verse is beyond a one-in-a-billion         chance. The following examples for 911 not only demonstrate the 911 theme         but also are further evidence of the Bible's perfection. Given the 31,102 Bible verses, you will find just three sets of ten         verses having cross Bible verse sequence numbers ending in 9110-9119.         are found in the first, second and third  of  the Bible's 10,000 verse         sets. Each of these three sets of ten verses have sequence numbers strongly         repeated theme. Following is a bit about each of these 911 verse       sets. The 9110 - 9119th verse set 1Kings 11:1-10 corresponds to the verses of the Bible.         ten verses of a chapter 11. Evidences such as how these number align          suggest the depth of perfection to God's numbering beyond imagination.         women and the resulting anger of God. It was not only that he had so         women that worshiped other gods. The nation would suffer because         of these sins. These verses in 1Kings 11 fit the theme of 911: BV:9110 - 1:1 Now ..., BV:9111 - 11:2 ...the LORD had said to the           sons of Israel, "You shall not associate with them ... BV:9112 - 11:3 He had seven hundred           wives... . BV:9113 - 11:4 ... ... BV:9114 - 11:5 ... ... BV:9115 - 11:6           LORD... BV:9116 - 11:7 Then of Moab... BV:9117 - 11:8 Thus also he did ... . BV:9118 - 11:9 ... ...because his heart           was turned away from the LORD... BV:9119 - 11:10 ...but . The 19110 - 19119th verse set         are at Jerimiah 6:20-29 and are the 19110-19119th . To keep the example simple I'm only showing verse         6:26 which tells of the sins of Israel and how a coming destruction will       come upon as a result: Jer 6:26 O daughter of my people, ; Mourn as for an only son, A lamentation most bitter. . The 29110 - 29119th verse set 29110-29119         found in Galations 3:7 to 3:16. The text also fits 911 as Paul is         found rebuking the Galations and declaring a the curse upon them: "You         foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you..."         verse at Galations 3:10 states -- ; for it is written, " ..." concluding...the three verse sets         from the Lord. If you are like me, when you realize what God has         done you will develop a new respect for the accuracy of the Bible. -top-         911 but with numbers not printed in our Bibles today.          what I refer to God's DNA like numeric map. Several of the numbers pointing         reference mentioned above. A short explanation indicating the association       to 911 is found below each verse:         noted above. Note that some of the numbers are very strong, one of a         kind numbers in the Bible. Gen 11:9 ...             Babel...the LORD confused the language of the whole earth; ... Num 14:10 But all ... (4119th verse) 2Chr 36:5 Jehoiakim ... .            (11999th verse) 1Kin 19:11 ... the LORD was passing by! And           a great and strong wind was rending the mountains... (the Return of the Lord) 2Chr 33:2 according to...abominations of the nations... (11911th           verse) Rev 11:9 ... ... (11:9           is same as 9:11) -top- Israel's six day war -  Jerusalem  returned to the Jews on June         7, 1967 On June 7, 1967 (6/7/1967) Jerusalem falls and is retaken by the Jews  	  in Israel's six day war. By June 7th Israel had basically won the war.  	  This war is sometimes called the 1967 war. It appears the date of this  	  67 which speaks of God giving his people rest or victory on the 7th day. This is an interesting date and event, but is it somehow  found         Bible? I believe yes and the clues begin with this important verse at         Exodus 17:16: Exo 17:16 and he said, "The LORD has sworn; the LORD   will have war against Amalek from generation to generation." So how do I relate this verse with this special date in history? First,         1000 verses in the Bible - it is the 2000th verse of the Bible and is         and the beginning of another. It is the conclusion of the historical         events to deliver Israel out of Egypt. The symbolism related to the number         two is also important--this being the 2000th         verse relates it strongly to the number 2 which is about Jesus, the one         appointed to redeem his people. For example, Exodus, the 2nd book is         about Moses,         out of Egypt. This specific verse is the culmination of the events leading Israel         that even though this battle with Amalek to deliver the Jews is won,         the LORD will have many more of these battles over the generations. God         seems to be saying that Israel will do this over and over again--they         do. So we can see the relationship with the event of this battle documented         on June 7, 1967. I know,  that seems like an interesting correlation         but is there more that ties them together? - glad you asked... I first considered the relationship of this verse to the 6/7/1967 date         through the verse reference of 17:16. It is difficult to explain, but         this assumption. Because of the special nature of this 2000th verse;         the content being about the delivery of Israel from Egypt; the similarity         of the 6/7/1967 date to the 17:16 verse reference ; and         date, I've         guessed for a long time that the date was related to the Bible's symbolism         for the number 67. But it was just recently (January 2010) that I made         two more startling observations - of the Bible, an interesting coincidence-or         is it? This specific verse 16 is .         All I could say to myself was -- Wow! There's even more - this is also         end of this part of Israel's history. All these         confirmation of the relationship of this verse to this date in history.         I don't imagine how it is possible for all these things         lining up by sheer  coincidence.           #67? -         seven together in the Bible.  The         6 days work and the 7th is rest but there is more. Note how all the following         7th of a series of different types of things. It can be the seventh year,         month, day or even seventh item in a list. These verses seem         he did on 6/7/1967. Exo 34:21 "               six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; Exo 31:17 … in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and was refreshed." Deu 15:12 "If…a Hebrew…is sold to you, then         serve you six years, but in the seventh year you shall set him free . Job 5:19 " From six troubles He will deliver you, . Exo 24:16 The glory of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and         cloud covered it for six days; and on the seventh day He called to Moses .         on the seventh of a series of events. It is not only that the seventh         day is a sabbath day for rest, but that God has given us the seventh         and sabbath day for rest. Mrk 2:27 Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, and         not man for the Sabbath.         this symbolism we find this theme. One more thing in case you missed         the relationship earlier --         was freed on 6/7/1967 in a war that was called Israel’s ….on         the 7th day they rested? Again, the preciseness of the Bible is amazing…judge for yourself   of the Bible’s divine numbering. God is Good! Interesting... For general interest, other  numbers  related         to 911 are: 99 -- 9 x 11 -- related to last things 92 -- 9 and 1 and 1 29 -- same as 92 18 -- 9 x 2 81 -- same as 18 -top- -top-        © 2001-2014 by AmazingWord - Norm Patriquin

Reinach, Switzerland, 9 April 2013 – Evolva Holding SA (SIX: EVE) today announced its financial results for the period 1 January to 31 December 2011. The annual report is available on Evolva’s website. : The acquisition of our first marketed product: resveratrol The entry of our vanillin product into pre-production in collaboration with IFF : Total cash position at 31 December 2012: CHF 9.1m (excluding CHF 1m in restricted cash) Successful fundraising in March 2013 with gross proceeds of CHF 31.3m Neil Goldsmith, CEO of Evolva said, “In 2012, and even more so in early 2013, the strategic shift that we embarked upon some three years ago delivered tangible results. Our products are making tremendous progress and the great success of the recent share issue shows that investors increasingly see the merit of our strategy. Whilst we are sorry that Jutta Heim, our Chief Scientific Officer, has decided to step down from a management role, we are very pleased that she will remain as an advisor, and that she is willing to join our Board of Directors. We most definitely thank her for her important contribution to our research successes. We are confident to have found an excellent successor in Jørgen Hansen, who has been overall responsible for our vanillin and stevia products, in both cases with great results. Evolva has come a long way since its incorporation in 2004. As our products enter commercialisation we will face many new challenges, but challenges that we feel privileged to have.” CFO Jakob Dynnes Hansen commented, “The shift towards ingredients for health, nutrition and wellness is also becoming more visible in our financials. In 2012, costs for clinical development came down significantly, helping us reduce our cash burn. At the same time, revenues from the new R&D partnerships and from our emerging product pipeline provide a good basis for a profitable future.” Evolva has a proprietary, fermentation-based platform that allows radically different approaches to the production of ingredients for the food, beverage and consumer health sectors. Evolva acquired its resveratrol product from Fluxome Sciences A/S (Denmark) (‘‘Fluxome’’) in November 2012. The Fluxome product has been on the US market since 2010, but primarily due to Fluxome’s high production costs has not generated significant sales. It has Self-Affirmed GRAS (“Generally Recognised As Safe”) status in the United States and obtained Novel Foods authorisation from the European Commission in January 2012 through the notification procedure. Evolva expects to leverage the Technology Platform to reduce production costs, and thereby further strengthen the competitive position of its resveratrol product. The product will be toll-manufactured by specialised third-party manufacturers. Evolva expects to be able to bring down the cost of goods to an economically viable level, so that it may generate a positive cash flow by 2014. Evolva does not intend to build a significant sales and marketing organisation for resveratrol but will instead work with distributors and major consumer goods companies to drive sales of the product once the cost of goods reaches an economically viable level. Stevia – zero-calorie, natural sweetener On 5 March 2013, Evolva entered into a product partnership with Cargill to jointly develop and commercialise fermentation-derived steviol glycosides. As part of the agreement, Cargill made a CHF 4.5 million (approximately USD 4.8 million) equity investment in Evolva in March 2013. Additionally, Evolva stands to receive up to USD 7.5 million in milestone payments and has the right to a 45% participation in the final business. If Evolva decides not to use this right it will receive royalty payments from global sales of the co-developed steviol glycoside products; these royalties will range from mid-single digit to low double-digit percentages as a function of sales volume and other parameters. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership, Cargill has the exclusive right to commercialise any fermentation-derived steviol glycosides developed as a result of the partnership. The steviol glycoside product is expected to progress into pilot scale in 2014. Based on current plans and expectations, the first fermentation-derived steviol glycoside product is expected to be available for commercial launch in 2015/2016. In January 2011, Evolva entered into a product partnership with IFF with the purpose of collaborating on the implementation of a commercial viable biosynthetic route for the production of vanillin. Pursuant to the terms of the partnership, IFF has the exclusive right to commercialise any fermentation-derived vanillin product developed as a result of the partnership in certain market segments. Evolva has successfully constructed the production route to vanillin and has filed a number of patent applications (some already granted) for this production approach. As of February 2013, Evolva has achieved the production yield, titre (i.e. concentration) and productivity that will allow the commercial launch of its vanillin product. Evolva is continuing to research ways to further improve the production process with the aim of lowering the cost of goods over time. On 5 February 2013, Evolva and IFF announced that they have entered into the pre-production phase to develop and scale up, via a third party, fermentation-derived vanillin for commercial application through a cost-effective, natural and sustainable route. The two companies are working to confirm scalability and yield targets through a yeast-based fermentation route during the pre-manufacturing phase. Based on current plans and expectations, Evolva expects its fermentation-derived vanillin product to be available for commercial launch in 2014. Saffron – colour, flavour and fragrance Research on saffron is primarily conducted at Evolva’s Chennai site. After identifying pathways and filing multiple patent applications, Evolva has introduced the pathway into yeast and produced individually the key saffron components responsible for the three prime attributes of saffron, namely flavour, fragrance and colour. Evolva is currently optimising the production process in order to enable commercial production of these components. Evolva expects fermentation-derived saffron to be available for commercial launch in 2016. Evolva’s current aim is to bring its saffron product as far as possible towards manufacturing and commercialisation before it considers entering into a product partnership with respect to the product. PomecinsTM are Evolva’s proprietary compounds, originating from plants, for the prevention of mould and yeast growth, with potential uses in crop protection, personal care, food preservation and consumer health care. Evolva has conducted pre- and post-harvest field studies with two PomecinTM compounds that indicate a potential to prevent fungal attacks in various crops. Evolva has also developed an innovative formulation of PomecinTM for topical treatment of onychomycosis (nail fungus). One family of patents is granted and in force and other related subject matter is covered in currently pending patent applications. Evolva has decided to exploit the PomecinTM family of antifungals in collaboration with partners, with only limited further investment by Evolva beyond their current stage. Until 2010, the activities of Evolva were primarily focused on the discovery and clinical development of novel pharmaceutical products. However, Evolva gradually refocused its strategy to discovering, developing and producing innovative ingredients that have application in the health, nutrition and wellness sectors. Evolva has a small number of clinical-stage or preclinical pharmaceutical product candidates, which, due to this strategy shift, it considers to be “legacy products”. Although it believes EV-077 and EV-035, the two pharmaceutical product families constituting these legacy products, are potentially highly attractive and have significant value, any continuing development of these products would be done either via out-licensing or a spin-off. Evolva does not plan to make any further material investment with respect to such products, with the exception of certain small investments to maintain their value. Evolva has, and intends to maintain, a number of partnerships around its technology and research capabilities – deploying its technology to provide a competitive edge to partner companies and sharing in the returns they make. 2012 saw additional partnerships in food and nutrition, as well as good progress on existing projects. The first quarter of 2013 brought several breakthroughs in our partnering portfolio. Evolva’s revenues to date have been derived from research and development projects with partners in the US, Europe and Asia. These R&D partnerships involve the use of the technology platform to develop new products and production methods for new and existing products that are of interest to our partners. We expect these R&D partnerships to continue to contribute the majority of revenues for at least the next two to three years. However, it is a key part of our strategy to gradually build an additional and, ultimately, primary revenue base through the commercialisation of our products, either with or without partners. More information on our existing partnerships is available in the 2012 annual report and in the section ‘Products’, above. As of 31 December 2012, the total headcount of Evolva amounts to 82 FTE (2011: 86), of which 61 (2011: 62) are directly involved in R&D activities while the remaining staff are employed with managerial, commercial and administrative tasks. In February 2013, Evolva announced that Norbert Bender, Chief Medical Officer, will be taking up a position at another company with effect from 1 June 2013. In line with its strategy of focusing on ingredients for health, wellness and nutrition, Evolva does not intend to hire a replacement. Very recently, Professor, Dr. Jutta Heim announced her decision to step down as Chief Scientific Officer. She will remain as an advisor to Evolva, as well as being willing to join the Board of Directors. The Board will nominate her to be elected in the shareholders’ meeting of 7 May 2013. Jutta will be succeeded by Dr. Jørgen Hansen. He has run Evolva’s Danish research team for the last eight years, during which time he has been in particular responsible for the vanillin and stevia projects. The Evolva stock price ended the year 2012 at CHF 0.36, compared with CHF 0.54 at the end of 2011. This performance was in line with the negative trend among other biosynthetic companies. On average, some 202,000 Evolva shares were traded per day in 2012 (2011: 98,000). CHF million (IFRS, consolidated) 2012 2011 Revenues 7.0 11.1 R&D costs -19.5 -27.5 G&A costs -7.5 9.5 Net result -16.7 -22.9 Equity financing 1.9 0.9 Cash at end of period 1) 9.1 22.7 Net cash flow 1) -12.6 -15.0 Equity at end of period 61.2 73.2 Earnings per share (CHF) -0.09 -0.14 1) Cash at year-end 2012 and net cash flow of 2012 do not include CHF 1 million in restricted cash. During 2012, the Company completed the shift of its revenue base from projects for the US Department of Defense (2% of total revenues in 2012 versus 51% in 2011 and 80% in 2010) to revenues from corporate clients such as IFF, Roquette and Roche (90% of total revenues in 2012). About 10% of the revenues in 2012 originated from research grants from national and EU institutions. Total operating expenses declined from CHF 37.0 million to CHF 27.1 million, a drop of CHF 9.9 million of which CHF 1.8 million represented lower charges for the Company‘s option programme. Technology and discovery costs (excl. option charges) declined from CHF 17.7 million to CHF 15.0 million primarily due to the expiry (as per contract) of a bio-defence project in early 2012, which led to the closure of the Company’s subsidiary in Palo Alto, California, in March 2012. Costs for development (excl. option charges) dropped from CHF 8.2 million in 2011 to CHF 3.5 million. This reflected partly the expiry in 2011 of a major bio-defence project, partly that costs for the clinical development of EV-077 were not recurring, and finally a reduction in development staff costs in 2012. The Company incurred non-cash expenses of CHF 3.3 million in 2012 for its incentive option plans, compared with CHF 5.0 million in 2011. Both financial income and financial expenses declined during 2012 mainly because of significantly lower currency fluctuations during the reporting period compared to 2011. The Company posted a gain of CHF 2.6 million in 2012 because of the expiry of the earn-out commitment to the former Abunda shareholders. Total general & administrative costs (excl. option charges) declined from CHF 7.1 million to CHF 5.7 million. This drop reflects partly the transaction costs in 2011 in connection with the Abunda acquisition and the SEDA agreement, partly a general reduction in facility and administration costs across the Evolva Group. Evolva’s cash balance decreased from CHF 22.7 million at the end of 2011 to CHF 9.1 million at the end of 2012. Adjusting for the CHF 1 million in restricted cash at year-end 2012, the total net cash burn in 2012 amounted to CHF 12.6 million, which was CHF 2.4 million or 16% lower than in 2011. The cash outflow from operating activities was reduced from CHF 17.4 million to CHF 13.4 million, reflecting lower expenditure in all major expense categories. Cash inflow from financing declined from CHF 3.5 million in 2011 (primarily proceeds from the Abunda acquisition) to CHF 1.5 million (before allocation to restricted cash). Proceeds from SEDA financing amounted to CHF 1.9 million compared to CHF 0.8 million in 2011. Equity decreased from CHF 73.2 million to CHF 61.3 million at the end of 2012 mainly as a result of the net loss in 2012. In March 2013, Evolva successfully raised additional funds through a rights issue to existing investors. Due to the high level of demand from international institutional investors, Evolva increased the size of the financing from the level indicated in August 2012 (CHF 10-20 million) to CHF 31.3 million. As part of the collaboration on steviol glycosides with Evolva, Cargill, Inc. invested CHF 4.5 million in the financing. Based on the 3-for-10 subscription ratio, the maximum number of shares to be issued was 52.2 million. At a subscription price of CHF 0.60 per share, the maximum proceeds were CHF 31.3 million. The subscription period ran from 12 March until 19 March. The rights were not tradable. Existing shareholders took up 24.2 million shares, or 46.3% of the total of 52.2 million shares, available in the rights offering. After allowing for the subscription of existing shareholders, 28.0 million new shares were placed with Cargill, Inc. and institutional investors. As reported on 6 March 2013, Cargill, institutional investors as well as Evolva Board and management had pre-committed to purchase up to 47.4 million shares (CHF 28.5 million), so that not all pre-commitments by new investors could be satisfied. After expenses, net proceeds are approx. CHF 28.3 million. The capital increase also included the issuance of 14 million treasury shares (held by Evolva). These will be used to satisfy part of Evolva’s obligations towards APIDC/Ventureast and the SEDA arrangement with YA Global. The Company expects revenues in 2013 to increase to CHF 10-13 million (2012: CHF 7 million) as a result of new R&D partnerships, incl. the agreement with Ajinomoto (signed in January 2013). Existing R&D partnerships are expected to continue throughout the year. Operating costs are expected to increase as a consequence of new R&D partnerships, additional investment in internal projects (incl. the stevia project partnered with Cargill) as well as financing costs. The net cash outflow from operating and investing activities is expected to be approx. CHF 12-15 million. The Company conducted an equity financing in March 2013 which provided net proceeds of approx. CHF 28.3 million. Taking into account the cash available before the financing and the projected operating cash flow, the Company expects the cash position at the end of 2013 to be at least CHF 25 million.

Today's Globe A&E / / Pats' hall of fame levels playing field State-of-the-art video, audio feeds let disabled tackle museum at their own pace / January 26, 2009 | | | | + F OXBOROUGH  - New England Patriots fans with visual or hearing impairments soon can get closer to their team, thanks to a hand-held  device that resembles a BlackBerry set in a thick rubber case. The Hall at Patriot Place, the Kraft Group's five-month-old Patriots football hall of fame next to Gillette Stadium, this week expects to add a listening and closed-captioning system that will allow people with disabilities to experience the museum in much the same fashion as visitors who are not disabled. The hand-held devices are pocket computers that pick up infrared or FM radio signals beamed from transmitters in the ceiling. The system tracks visitors as they move about, triggering audio descriptions for the blind and closed captioning or enhanced audio for those with hearing problems. The technology allows visitors to move about the museum at their own pace. Audio and video broadcast at the museum are synchronized precisely with the information on the devices. "We want people who are disabled and not disabled to have a common experience when they come here," said Paul Fruia, project manager for Houston-based Softeq Development, the company that installed the system for team owner Robert Kraft's organization. The museum features wrap-around video screens that show highlights of the Patriots' three Super Bowl victories and other key games. There are also game balls, uniforms, memorabilia, and interactive kiosks. One of the more popular exhibits is a re-created huddle that includes life-size statues of players and quarterback Tom Brady calling a play. Visitors can stand in the huddle and hear Brady bark instructions. For a visitor who is deaf, the hand-held device runs closed captioning at the same time Brady is speaking. Visitors who have partial hearing can wear headphones that receive enhanced audio from an FM transmitter. For those who are visually impaired, the device describes the scene in the huddle. The Hall at Patriot Place is one of the first US museums to use this technology. Disney World, in Orlando, Fla., and the World of Coke in Atlanta recently installed similar systems. "There are not many museums anywhere that allow people with sensory disabilities to have this kind of access," said Kevin McGuire, a consultant who has advised Kraft Group on Gillette Stadium and the Patriot Place shopping and entertainment complex. Activists and advocates for the disabled say they welcome the system. "This is a state-of-the-art system that makes the best possible use of technology," said commissioner Heidi L. Reed of the Massachusetts Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. "It is an important step forward." Lise Hamlin, director of public policy and state development for the Hearing Loss Association of America, said the key aspect of the system is that it allows disabled visitors to go through the museum at their own speed. Engineers were doing final installation and testing of the system last week. It is expected to be fully operational this week. While the system at the Patriots' hall is new, the technologies it uses have been around for some time. Infrared signals have been in widespread use since television remote controls were invented decades ago. Closed captioning was developed in the 1970s. And the hand-held computer is similar to the mobile computing and communication devices that have flooded the consumer market in recent years. The rugged casing allows the device to survive a drop to the floor and makes it water-resistant. Fruia, the Softeq project manager, said what makes the device special is its software, which allows the machine to perform multiple functions in response to users' differing needs. Larry Goldberg, director of media access for WGBH public broadcasting in Boston, said, "It is a matter of taking a device that has common mainstream uses and reengineering it for another population." For those with disabilities, however, technological advancement has been a mixed blessing. Some innovations, such as voice recognition and closed captioning, have dramatically helped them to overcome their disabilities. But high-technology products aimed at mass markets often make no provisions for the disabled, effectively pushing them further from the mainstream. "Advanced technology can leave people with disabilities behind," said Rosaline Crawford, director of the National Association for the Deaf Law and Advocacy Center.While almost all television shows now have closed captioning, only a small proportion of US movie theaters are equipped with closed captioning or assistive listening technology. Many museums have descriptive audio for the blind or visually impaired, but rarely are there closed-captioning devices for the deaf and hard of hearing. WGBH's media access group produced the closed captioning and audio descriptions for the devices used at the Hall at Patriot Place. The public broadcasting station has been a pioneer in such technologies since it invented closed captioning for a Julia Child cooking show in 1972. Softeq officials say devices designed for people with disabilities could eventually have wider uses, such as foreign language translation and special programming for children. Ryan Dour, 29, who is blind and lives in Chicago, used devices like the ones at the Hall at Patriot Place during a recent visit to Disney World. He said the system transformed his park experience and enriched his life. He is planning another visit to Disney World this winter. "It's about having the opportunity to be included in the experience," Dour said. "Now when the rest of the audience is laughing, I'm laughing, too." preer@globe.com . © Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

The dagger we have depicted here is based on a 14th C, example from the collection of the Royal Armouries in Leeds. This dagger style is depicted in art and example from the early medieval period right through to the 16th C. this is a classic weapon of the medieval soldier. While the original of this dagger is attributed as possibly English in origin by the Royal Armouries, many examples of this style appear in art, from the earliest we have found in the Hrabanus Maurus Monte Cassino, written in the second quarter of the 11th C., and seen in the famous Maciejowski Bible where it is depicted in several of the Battle scenes being employed by soldiers and Knights. This style of fighting knife was popular throughout Europe and the H shaped hilt developed into the famous Holbien daggers of the Renaissance period. The hilt is crafted with hand formed steel guard and pommel and a stained hard wood grip.

Noriega witness reportedly left U.S. last month August 08, 1991 | MIAMI -- U.S. government agents allowed a key Colombian witness against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to leave the United States last month, prompting an internal investigation at the U.S. Customs Service and fears that the incident could jeopardize the drug conspiracy case against the ousted Panamanian leader, according to well-placed government sources. In independent interviews, the sources told Newsday that Boris Olarte Morales, a Colombian convicted on federal drug-smuggling charges in Oklahoma, had left for Colombia last month, reportedly cleared by the Customs Service. He was free on probation based on his cooperation in many drug cases. The sources said they did not know why Olarte had been allowed to leave, saying it could have been merely an administrative error. But one source said his departure could lead to charges either that the government was trying to damage its own case by making a crucial witness unavailable or that it was trying to protect its case from attacks by the defense based on contradictions in Olarte's story. Speculation that the government might try to damage its own case is based on the concern of several federal agencies that the defense will highlight General Noriega's relationship with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA.

Basketball player killed off-campus 21-year-old from Glen Burnie held without bond April 19, 2010 | By Childs Walker, The Baltimore Sun Students and administrators at Frostburg State University shared grief and disbelief Monday after a deadly weekend shooting shattered the usual peace of their remote campus in the Western Maryland mountains. Frostburg sophomore Tyrone Hall, 21, is accused of shooting two fellow students, both members of the school's basketball team, with a shotgun early Sunday morning after a fight that began at an off-campus party. The Glen Burnie native, who was a high school soccer star in Baltimore, has been charged with first-degree murder and first-degree attempted murder and is being held without bond at the Allegany County Detention Center. Hall told police he fired in self-defense after both men lunged at him, according to charging documents released Monday. Brandon Carroll, a 20-year-old sophomore from Waldorf, was killed in the shooting. His teammate, 21-year-old junior Ellis Hartridge Jr. of Washington, D.C., was also shot but is expected to survive. Coaches and acquaintances described both victims as outgoing, popular students who had their lives on the right track. "It's a freak thing," said incoming student government president Ian Spears, a junior from Prince George's County. "What's supposed to happen at Frostburg is a bear wandering on campus, not a student being murdered in cold blood. I finally understand why people always get on the news and say, ‘I didn't think it could happen in my town.'" Fellow basketball players spent much of Sunday with the recovering Hartridge and are helping each other through an emotionally trying time, said coach Webb Hatch. "The range of emotions is varied," Hatch said. "You're talking about men ranging from age 19 to 22, most of whom have not experienced the loss of a peer. … A couple of the kids are really struggling, but I've got a pretty good feeling that they're all very much in touch. They have a tendency to look out for each other." Frostburg President James Gibralter said the campus of 5,385 was "saddened" by the shooting. "I wish to offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Brandon Carroll," he said. "The entire university community is behind them and we will feel the impact of his loss for a very long time. I am relieved to hear that Ellis Hartridge will recover, and send our best wishes to his family and friends as well." The university's student government has planned a candlelight march at 8:30 p.m. Tuesday with a vigil service that begins at 9 p.m. The university has also made counselors available to speak to students. "The mood of the campus is really still shock," Spears said. "This doesn't happen at Frostburg." Spears said students used text and Facebook messages to organize an impromptu moment of silence in front of the campus cafeteria Sunday. Hundreds showed up, many still in tears as they processed news that was but a few hours old. Spears had seen Carroll on Saturday and exchanged friendly words about a recent concert. He said Carroll, who went by the nickname BC, was approachable and popular. "He played basketball, but he wasn't cocky about it," he said. "He was real humble. He was a guy who was legitimately doing what he was supposed to do with his life, and he was gunned down for no reason." Many students posted short messages about Carroll on their Facebook pages, offering prayers and saying they believed he would watch over them from heaven. His teammate, Brian Anderson, wrote of Carroll, "#1 on the court. #1 in our hearts. We all love you." Hatch said Carroll transferred into the basketball program this year and never sulked as he rode the bench for most of the season. "I don't know that he had any enemies," the coach said. "He wouldn't hurt a flea." Hatch had just met with the 6-foot-4 Carroll, a strong student, to discuss their mutually high expectations for his junior season. "His teammates are devastated," he said. "He was well-liked and they had a sense that by next year, he was going to be a real factor on the court." Hartridge also transferred to Frostburg and came into the season as an unknown entity, Hatch said. "By midseason, he was starting, because he simply outworked everyone," the coach said. Hatch had just come from visiting Hartridge in the hospital on Monday afternoon and said the player was alert and "seems to be fine." Hall, the alleged shooter, was also an athlete, a former soccer star at Mount St. Joseph High School in Baltimore who was recruited to play in college, though he was not on the roster at Frostburg. One former coach described him as an exceptional, gifted athlete. "He had a lot of talent as a player," said Steve Campbell, co-director of coaching for Freestate Soccer Alliance, based in Bowie. Campbell coached Hall for two years but had not spoken to him since the summer after his freshman year in college. | | MORE: Miller guilty in 1998 death of teen-ager Mrs. Mandela allegedly acknowledges love affair and misuse of ANC funds Frostburg student fatally stabbed at off-campus party November 6, 2011 April 18, 2010 April 29, 2014 April 23, 2010 | | | Please note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors, reporters or any other editorial staff.
A&E A&E L.A. eyeing slavery-era disclosure ordinance May 16, 2003 | By Matea Gold, Tribune Newspapers: Los Angeles Times. LOS ANGELES â€” The Los Angeles City Council was to vote Friday on whether to pursue a new ordinance that would require every company that does business with the city to report whether it ever profited from slavery. The ordinance would be difficult to enforce, but supporters call it a potent symbol in the movement to establish reparations for descendants of slaves. "There has to be some recompense," said April Lawrence, student body president of Los Angeles Southwest College, after testifying Wednesday before a council committee considering the measure. "There are many, many facets to reparations, and one of them is to regain dignity. We can't get our history properly documented without knowing the truth behind everything." If the council approves the measure, Los Angeles would be the second U.S. city to require such disclosure. In Chicago, which passed a similar law in the fall, no businesses have yet reported any history of slave profits, according to a spokeswoman for Chicago's procurement department. Councilman Nate Holden, who proposed the Los Angeles ordinance, called it a big step in reminding the public of how slavery has shaped society. "I think it's going to raise the sensitivity level," said Holden, comparing the measure to efforts to seek reparations for Holocaust victims. "I think they'll be reminded of the fact, `Never again."' The law would require any company doing business with the city to research its records and sign an affidavit stating whether it or its predecessor companies ever profited from slavery. If a company found any records, it would be required to disclose them to the city. Those companies would not be barred from working for the city, but Holden said he would ask them to consider funding scholarships or other programs to help blacks. Councilwoman Jan Perry, who seconded Holden's motion, said she hopes the law would encourage those companies to aid economic development projects in poor communities. It is unclear what businesses, if any, would be affected by the Los Angeles law. Supporters said railroad companies and development interests are the most likely to have ties to slavery-era investments.

New Owners: Buy Furniture Made To Hold Your Computer August 11, 1994 | By John M. Moran; Courant Columnist John M. Moran is The Courant's on-line reporter, covering computers, networks, bulletin-board systems and related topics. For information on how to reach him, please see the last item under Pixels on the cover of this section. About an hour after they buy their first computer, many people suddenly realize they have no place to put it. The kitchen table isn't going to work, the desk in the study is too high, and that old typing table isn't big enough. The solution seems easy: Buy furniture specially made to hold computer equipment and related items. But finding what you need at a price you want to pay may not be so easy. For one thing, if you recently bought your first computer, you may not know what you need. For another, there's no guarantee that the store's sales people know any more about this than you do. The goal is to find furniture that will help you avoid injury and allow you to work or play comfortably at your computer for as long as you like. The way to do that is to assume a proper posture -- feet flat on the floor, thighs and forearms parallel to the floor, and eyes looking straight at the monitor. Ergonomic furnishings will help you achieve this posture, said Anne L. Bracker, an industrial hygienist at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington. ``The concept of ergonomics means fitting the work environment to the human,'' Bracker said. ``It's basically a recognition that we're not machines, we're people.'' Working comfortably requires the proper desk, chair, lighting and accessories. Here are some things to keep in mind while you're shopping: * Desk -- A good computer desk fits you. Its surface should be somewhat lower than a regular desk so you can type comfortably. It should have some extra desktop space to hold your papers and books while you work, and it should be sturdy. Other desirable features include an adjustible shelf to hold the computer monitor and perhaps a special shelf to lower the keyboard to the proper height for typing. ``The No. 1 thing is having the keyboard at the right height,'' said Joseph P. Aiello, president of Opta- Vision, a computer safety products supplier in South Windsor. * Chair -- A good desk chair can mean the difference between hours of fun or hours of pain. It should have a padded seat, firm support for the lower back, and a way to adjust the height. Chairs come in a wide variety of styles and prices. Buying the right chair is essential, said Barbara G. Stahl, furniture manager for Gustave Fischer Inc., an office supplier in West Hartford. ``The cheapest is not always the best. I guess it all boils down to that,'' she said. * Lighting -- There are two aspects to lighting a computer work area: getting the light you want, and avoiding the light you don't want. The light you want is an adjustable desktop lamp that illuminates your work surface without casting shadows elsewhere. The light you don't want is glare from a window, from a room lamp, or from your desk lamp. * Accessories -- A number of accessories can also help keep you comfortable and pain-free in front of your computer. Wrist rests can help keep your wrists in the proper position while typing. Foot rests can help put your legs in the right position, too, if you're shorter than average or your chair or desktop doesn't adjust.

YOU ARE HERE: February 27, 1986 Los Angeles is using a show-biz approach to promote its 10-year-old Westwood shuttle bus service, which provides transportation between the Federal Building and Westwood Village on weekends for only 25 cents. The city's 30-second film, starring Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, will be shown in Westwood movie theaters this spring along with other public service announcements and film previews. The brief film is designed to remind the public that the shuttle service provides free parking at the Federal Building and a 25-cent ride into Westwood Village, officials said. The shuttle is intended to reduce congestion in Westwood Village with its many restaurants, movie theaters and stores, they said. "The Westwood shuttle can help solve parking problems in Westwood," said Donald Howery, director of the city Transportation Department, which sponsors the shuttle. Ridership averages about 250 a day, he said. The department decided to make a film because officials considered it an effective way to reach "a good cross section" of visitors who frequent Westwood, Howery said. The filming took place last weekend in the parking lot at the Federal Building at Wilshire Boulevard and Veteran Avenue. The shuttle's circular route proceeds from the Federal Building east on Wilshire, north on Glendon Avenue, west on Weyburn Avenue, south on Gayley Avenue and west on Wilshire to the starting point. Buses leave every eight minutes beginning at 6:30 p.m. Fridays and at 11:30 a.m. Saturdays, and run until 1:30 a.m. both days.

YOU ARE HERE: May 30, 1986 A San Clemente woman, stunningly turned out in a black and white outfit and white felt hat, testified that accused spy Jerry Whitworth and his wife showered her with lavish gifts and $6,600 in loans. Celia Vanderpool, a teaching specialist, said she was introduced to Whitworth in 1979 by a boyfriend. The Whitworth wedding was a posh affair attended by John Walker, the admitted organizer of the Walker family spy ring that Whitworth, 46, is alleged to have served, Vanderpool said. Up to Whitworth's arrest in May, 1985, she said, he and his wife, Brenda, would take her to the finest restaurants where "the sky was the limit." "Jerry had this one habit that was fun," the witness said. "He would keep stopping by and replenishing my liquor cabinet." Vanderpool said Whitworth lent her about $6,600, mostly in cash. The government is trying to prove in the San Francisco federal court trial that Whitworth lived far beyond his means--on money paid to him by the Soviet Union.

YOU ARE HERE: Bills to Repeal Snack Food Tax Fail :  Sacramento: Assembly committee rejects plans that also would remove levies on newspapers and magazines. August 27, 1991 | DOUGLAS P. SHUIT | SACRAMENTO â€” Legislation to repeal the new state sales tax on snack foods, newspapers and magazines was dealt a sharp setback Monday in the Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee. Two bills to repeal the new taxes--one that would replace the lost revenues with an increase in cigarette taxes and one that would substitute a new oil tax--were defeated by lopsided margins. Opponents included Gov. Pete Wilson, lobbyists for tobacco companies, business groups, oil companies and lawmakers from both parties. The bill to substitute the snack food and newspaper tax bills with a new cigarette tax was rejected 5 to 2. The second bill did even worse, getting only two votes in favor and six against. The author of the bill to raise the tobacco tax, Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), moved to have the legislation reconsidered. But he said the vote left him with little hope of seeing the sales tax measures repealed. Connelly said the committee members voted despite widespread expressions of anger over the new taxes. "If they are not willing to move now I think in point of fact, unfortunately, the anger of the moment will pass, the public will accept it, and we will have adopted and implemented what I think is a bad tax policy when we could have gotten the same revenue with a good tax policy--that is taxing tobacco instead of food." A poll commissioned by several major newspaper publishers and businesses in the snack food industry showed that Californians, by a 3-1 margin, preferred higher tobacco taxes to the new tax on their products. Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), the author of the second bill, said he was not giving up. His bill would have repealed the new sales tax on bottled water, as well as on snack foods, newspapers and magazines. He wanted to substitute in their place a 9% tax on oil as it is pumped from the wellhead. "We are the only major oil-producing state in the nation without an oil severance tax," O'Connell said. During the hearing, lobbyists and other representatives of newspapers and magazines said the tax is coming when the publishing industry is reeling from a recession and a number of publications, such as California magazine, are going out of business. Officials of small magazines said the new tax was expensive and difficult for them to administer, forcing them in many cases to pay the tax themselves rather than pass it on to their subscribers. Snack food manufacturers argued that the new sales tax on their products is difficult to administer and confusing to consumers, leaving such items as doughnuts untaxed while taxing nearly identical products, such as Ding Dongs. Opponents on the committee argued that the new taxes were part of a complex deal to reduce a projected $14.3-billion deficit and that they were reluctant to pass anything that, in the words of one lawmaker, "would tear it apart."

YOU ARE HERE: Barber's touch is 'feminine' April 06, 2006 | MAY LEE JOHNSON, Tribune Columnist | MAY LEE JOHNSON, Tribune Columnist Adeline Wigfall Jones likes being on the cutting edge. As a licensed barber, she wields the clippers and razors just like her male counterparts. For this woman, being a barber just came naturally. "I was going to go to beauty school," she said. "But when I went to register for the class, it was already full. "I had always admired a female barber in Michigan City, so I decided to go to school to be a barber in Gary. "And here I am, still cutting hair over 30 years." She owns The Patch, on West Washington Street. It's more than just a barbershop. She has a full menu of hair services, and she sells Mary Kay products. Actually, female barbers are becoming a lot more common now. What was once an almost all-male profession is changing. Longtime male barbers are closing in on retirement age, and there are fewer young men stepping up to take their place. In addition, more men are going to chain-owned shops in shopping malls or elsewhere, and styling salons are becoming more unisex. With a room full of men waiting for a haircut, it's clear that Jones has the confidence and respect of her clients. "Some men handle your head too rough," said Joe Sutherland, a longtime customer. "I've been coming to her for over 30 years because I like the feminine touch." It's a compliment Jones has heard before, that her touch is careful. "It's gentler than a man's," she said. "It's more soothing, more relaxing." Frank Smith was in for a visit and was complimentary, too. "I used to get my hair cut here years ago," he said. "Right now I cut my own hair, but I must say I like what I see here today. She can cut hair." Jones' shop was listed as a Safe Place during National Safe Place Week in March. If a youth in crisis -- a runaway, for example -- needs help, he or she can stop at The Patch. Jones then will make calls to the Safe Place coordinator, so shelter, food or counseling will be made available.

YOU ARE HERE: Howard Twp. greenhouse owners plan to appeal latest decision. Howard Twp. greenhouse owners plan to appeal latest decision. June 07, 2006 | CASSOPOLIS -- It's back to appeals court for Larry and Lucyle Eckler's lawsuit against Howard Township. Cass County Circuit Court Judge Michael E. Dodge affirmed the township's 2002 decision to allow Moose Lake Aggregates mining operation on Barron Lake Road to expand. Eckler, whose ornamental farm and greenhouse is located across the street from the gravel pit, said he wasn't surprised by Dodge's written opinion filed June 1. "It's not unexpected because he (Dodge) had indicated a little over a year ago that he wasn't going to change his mind," said Eckler, who believes the gravel pit has damaged their crops and opposes Moose Lake's expansion. He and his wife now hope to plead their case before the Michigan Court of Appeals, which ruled favorably on an earlier appeal in the case. In 2002 Dodge dismissed their case after ruling that the Ecklers' original appeal of the township's decision had not been filed within the required time period. However, in 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals decided that the appeal was filed in a timely manner and sent it back to Cass County, where Dodge heard oral arguments on the case in April. Eckler is hopeful the Michigan Court of Appeals will hear their case. "The issues at hand haven't changed and the process of looking at how this is harmful or nonhazardous to the community needs to be looked at and addressed properly," Eckler said.

Police To Pound Wide-open Beat With New Chopper October 9, 1986 | By KELLY LEON, Staff Writer FORT LAUDERDALE -- Jim Purdy and Clyde Dillon fondly remember their five-day journey enclosed in a small, bubble-like compartment, 500 feet in the air with the whir of a propeller constantly sounding in their ears. But if Dillon ever flies across the country in a helicopter again, he said, he hopes the craft will be larger and air conditioned. Dillon, an officer for 13 years, and Purdy, a sergeant who also has 13 years on the force, are members of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department`s aviation unit. Last Sunday they returned from a five-day, 30-hour flight from Los Angeles aboard the department`s new $96,300 Robinson helicopter. ``It was long and hot,`` Purdy said of the flight that took the duo down ocean shorelines, over mountains, across deserts, through prairies and over swampland to a safe landing at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport. The 1,370-pound, two-seat helicopter, which will be used primarily to fight street-level crime, can race across the sky at more than 100 mph and can fly at an altitude of 14,000 feet, Purdy said. For most of the trip, he said, they flew the copter an average of six hours a day at about 500 feet. They went as high as 6,500 feet to clear the mountains in the west. The view that a helicopter provides is one of the main reasons the aircraft was purchased, Dillon said. It was paid for with money confiscated during drug arrests. Like a predatory bird stalking its prey, the helicopter has a clear view of drug deals, burglaries and robberies going on in streets, alleys and out-of- the-way places that squad cars can`t always reach, Dillon said. The helicopter will run routine daily patrols in different areas of the city and will help special units such as the Northwest Raiders, a street-level, anti-drug task force.

September 23, 1991 | By CHRIS LAZZARINO, Staff Writer When Green Bay cornerback LeRoy Butler finally shoved Mark Duper out of bounds to end a 40-yard pass play in the fourth quarter, he was stopping what he had hoped not to see. It was what no defense wants to see from the Dolphins. The long pass. ``We`ll let them catch outs all day,`` Butler said. ``We`ll let them catch 50 outs, if that`s what they want. Because we know they can`t beat us with short little out patterns.`` Butler was right. The 40-yard completion from Dan Marino to Duper set up a 31-yard Pete Stoyanovich field goal, which won the game for the Dolphins. It was also the Dolphins` longest pass of the season since the 43-yard flea- flicker from Marino to Mark Clayton that scored a touchdown in the opener at Buffalo. Between the 43-yarder to Clayton and the 40-yarder to Duper -- more than 14 quarters -- the Dolphins had completed no pass longer than 25 yards. And Marino has now gone two games without a touchdown pass. ``Defenses are doing things to make us not (go long),`` said Dolphins quarterback and pass offense coach Gary Stevens. ``We can`t take it if they don`t give it to us.`` On top of the desire to halt the long ball, Green Bay`s defense, with an emphasis on rushing linebackers and full-out attack on the quarterback, lends itself to short, quick passes. The Dolphins worked hard at that from the start, going to tight end Charles Henry on their first offensive play. As he did throughout the game, Henry dropped the ball, and a trend was set. So the short stuff wasn`t coming easy Sunday -- which made the Dolphins` receivers want the long ball that much more. ``I think we had a chance at that today,`` said Clayton, who left the game with a groin injury. In seven of his eight pro seasons, Clayton has had at least one reception of 40 or more yards. Duper has been even more effective going long, with a 50-yarder or better in seven of his nine seasons before 1991. But Duper knows the long pass will only become more difficult -- and not because of the much-disputed issue of speed. Even if Duper and Clayton lose a step, they are sure to always gather plenty of attention from defensive backs. ``When Clayton and I first came into the league, it was like a run-and- shoot,`` Duper said. ``But it doesn`t take much thought for defenses to realize what they have to do. They have to take the long ball away.`` Going into Sunday`s game, Marino was averaging 12.5 yards a completion. He got even fewer yards per completion Sunday against Green Bay, averaging 11.2 yards with 19 completions. With the Packers guarding against the long threat, Miami looked elsewhere -- and didn`t always find an answer. The Dolphins only rushed for 37 yards, yet three Dolphins` running backs caught passes Sunday, for a total of 49 yards. With Marino, Duper and Clayton always posing a threat, others clean up underneath. It is a situation that has helped the careers of Jim Jensen and Tony Paige, and led the Dolphins to draft Aaron Craver. Sure hands that can create crisp short-yardage completions -- and help open the field for the big guns to go long -- are well rewarded by the Dolphins. ``Defenses give us short passes,`` Duper said, ``and then make us run. A lot of defenses use the zone to stop us, but we also have fast receivers that can get behind the zone.`` Which is what Duper did on the 40-yarder, setting the Dolphins up with field position that allowed Stoyanovich to win the game. ``Green Bay has a pretty good rush, which makes you work at quick passes,`` Stevens said. ``But we threw it deep a few times, and made the big plays when we had to.`` MORE: Can Bosh, Wade break out of their funk?

Business/Corporate Maintaining an accurate inventory of fixed assets and capitalized equipment is critical to organizations of all sizes.  				As a whole, organizations realize significant savings and benefits through maintaining an accurate inventory.  				Facilities and IT departments benefit through increased control and accountability of assets, as well as savings in budgets  				from reallocating existing assets, and minimizing shrinkage. While finance departments often see benefits through tax and insurance savings,  				as well as compliance with grant and regulatory requirements. The following steps have been established to assist organizations maintain its investment in fixed assets and capitalized equipment. The first step in asset inventory management is to identify two critical roles, a program sponsor and a program champion.  					Executive level commitment is essential for the ongoing success of 	an asset inventory management program.  					The project sponsor provides the executive level commitment to the program. For most organizations, the equivalent of a “C” level executive is appropriate.  					Often the CFO of an organization will be the project sponsor. The project champion is responsible for implementing and maintaining the program strategy. Executive level support will be facilitated by presenting a good business case for the 	importance of asset management.  					Calculating the return on investment (ROI) for a program will support the business case.  					Utilize the Asset Services ROI Calculator to easily determine the anticipated return. The following is a list of items that should be considered in developing your strategy. Physical Inventory – How will the baseline inventory be established? Process for Updating the Asset Ledger – Who is responsible for reporting additions, moves, and liquidations to the inventory?  							How will the changes be communicated to the asset management team?

Measuring – How will the inventory accuracy be measured and maintained?  							Periodic physical inventories are the best way to measure the accuracy of the inventory.  							Larger organizations (more than 20,000 assets) may also benefit by performing periodic physical audits of assets. Accountability and Remediation – Who is responsible for,  							and what are the remediation strategies for not meeting appropriate inventory measurements? Very small organizations may be able to employ a “paper and pen” method for performing the physical inventory.  					This method requires printing out a list of assets from the asset ledger, and searching for each asset on the list.  					The “paper and pen” method may be a cost effective 	approach for small organizations with a single, one or two story building.  					However, organizations with multiple locations or floors limit the practicality and effectiveness of the “paper and pen” method. Utilizing a barcode methodology to an inventory is recommended for larger organizations.  					Although the physical inventory may be performed using internal resources, consider partnering with a company that specializes in providing asset management solutions.  					Advantages of outsourcing your physical inventory include leveraging the expertise and knowledge of the specialists, as well as accurate and efficient inventory results. 	 					Outsourcing your inventory needs also allows you to let your employees focus on their existing responsibilities. Have a Project?

DidYouKnowGaming? ---------- @Z TV & Movies on June 09 '17 at 11:02 AM Slashdot's setback-for-pepe-the-frog department : An anonymous reader shares a report: The rarest pepe is one found on the iOS App Store, and now we know why: Apple has categorized the meme frog as "objectionable content" and has rejected an app called Pepe Scream, Motherboard confirmed. "Your app contains images and references of Pepe the Frog, which are considered objectionable content," an Apple App Review Board employee named Nicole wrote in a rejection notice to Spirit Realm Games, the developer of Pepe Scream. "It would be appropriate to remove the references and revise the images in your app." MrSnrhms, a developer for Spirit Realm Games, gave Motherboard temporary access to the team's iOS developer account, which showed that Apple did indeed reject the app because it contains Pepe, a cartoon frog that has been increasingly associated with the alt-right.

( ) 'Quit Your Day Job Is Garbage Advice' on June 09 '17 at 11:02 AM Slashdot's do-the-smart-thing department : An anonymous reader shares an article: While Daymond John was building his clothing line FUBU, which would evolve into a $6 billion brand, the entrepreneur was living on the tips he made waiting tables at Red Lobster. "I was working at Red Lobster for five years as a waiter as I was running this business," the Shark Tank star said at the iConic conference in New York City on Wednesday. At first "it was 40 hours at Red Lobster and six hours at FUBU. Then it was 30 hours at Red Lobster and 20 hours at FUBU, because money started to come in." Even after FUBU started to take off, John continued waiting tables. He wouldn't do things any differently if he could, he told the audience on Wednesday: "Don't quit your day job. [...] Let's say I was making an average of $40,000 a year," he continued. "After five years, that's $200,000 of salary. I would have had to sell $1 million more worth of FUBU product to bring home the $200,000, but I didn't have to do that. I just had to sacrifice time." ( ) on June 09 '17 at 09:41 AM Slashdot's forced-habits department : An anonymous reader shares a report: Apple CEO Tim Cook delivered the commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Friday, and he couldn't help taking a swipe at a rival. In a section of his speech describing his search for answers and tough decisions in college and beyond, he admitted turning to a Microsoft computer. "I went to grad school at Duke, looking for the answer," Cook said. "I tried meditation. I sought guidance and religion. I read great philosophers and authors. In a moment of youthful indiscretion, I might even have experimented with a Windows PC. And obviously that didn't work." The line got a hearty laugh from the crowd. ( ) Intel: Steer Clear Of Our Patents on June 09 '17 at 09:41 AM Slashdot's making-clear department : An anonymous reader writes: Intel posted a long blog post yesterday touting the success and evolution of its 40-year-old x86 microprocessor -- the one that powered the first IBM personal computer in 1978 and still powers the majority of PCs and laptops. But it wasn't just a stroll down memory lane. Intel ended the post with a reminder that it won't tolerate infringement on its portfolio of patents, including those surrounding x86. The company wrote, "Intel invests enormous resources to advance its dynamic x86 ISA, and therefore Intel must protect these investments with a strong patent portfolio and other intellectual property rights. [...] Intel carefully protects its x86 innovations, and we do not widely license others to use them. Over the past 30 years, Intel has vigilantly enforced its intellectual property rights against infringement by third-party microprocessors. [...] Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition, and we are confident that Intel's microprocessors, which have been specifically optimized to implement Intel's x86 ISA for almost four decades, will deliver amazing experiences, consistency across applications, and a full breadth of consumer offerings, full manageability and IT integration for the enterprise. However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights.

From a report: The 11-minute trailer for philosophical pontificating simulator Everything is eligible for an Academy Award -- a first for a video game promotion, boasted game developer David OReilly. The marketing material in question is included under the Academy's category "[best] animated short film," which it became eligible for after winning the Jury Prize for animation at the VIS Vienna Shorts film festival. Everything's lengthy trailer focuses on the correlation between the universe's smallest, biggest, and most remote entities, all while being narrated by the late British philosopher Alan Watts. ( ) on June 09 '17 at 08:20 AM Slashdot's payback-time department : The founder and CEO of a shuttered Silicon Valley startup has been indicted for tricking employees into working without pay and for lying about his credentials and financing. From a report: In an indictment unsealed this week, Isaac Choi, founder and CEO of failed Silicon Valley job search startup WrkRiot, was charged with five counts of wire fraud for allegedly defrauding former employees. Problems at the upstart surfaced in August when Penny Kim, former head of marketing for the company, published an account of her experience at an unnamed biz. She said the unspecified outfit failed to pay her and forged wire transfer confirmations to make it appear it had transferred owed funds. After it emerged that Kim was talking about WrkRiot, the company threatened legal action. By the end of August, when former CTO Al Brown acknowledged being the person referred to as "Charlie" in Kim's post and corroborated her claims, WrkRiot had shut down its website and Facebook page. ( ) Google Has Finally Found a Buyer For Its Scary Robot Companies Boston Dynamics and Schaft: SoftBank on June 09 '17 at 07:00 AM Slashdot's new-home department : Japan's SoftBank is buying robotics group Boston Dynamics -- the makers of the bipedal Atlas, the jumping Sand Flea and the animal-like BigDog, Spot and Wildcat robots -- from Alphabet, more than a year after Google's parent put the unit up for sale. From a report: Google acquired Boston Dynamics in 2013 under the leadership of Andy Rubin, the co-inventor of Android, who was leading a wave of acquisitions of robotics companies under the search giant. Boston Dynamics' robots routinely make headlines, including a high-profile demo at this year's TED conference. The company, led by CEO Marc Raibert, has made a robotic cheetah that can run 28 miles per hour, a robotic dog that it recently used to deliver packages to doorsteps in Boston, and most recently a massive legged and wheeled robot that can clear hurdles and walk down stairs. The firm has been hailed by other roboticists for its ability to blend hardware and artificial intelligence to make machines capable of dynamic, agile movements. Its most recent wheeled robot, Handle, can manipulate objects that are comparable to its own weight, and its four-legged, animal-like robots can maneuver over different types of terrain. ( ) Skype Retires Older Apps for Windows, Linux on June 09 '17 at 07:00 AM Slashdot's leaving-people department : An anonymous reader writes: The newest version of the Skype app takes a big hat-tip from social media platforms like Snapchat and Facebook's Messenger with its newest features, adding a Stories-like feature called Highlights, a big selection of bots to add into chats and a longer plan to upgrade group conversations with more features. Now, as part of the effort to get people to use the new Skype more, the company is also doubling down on something else: Skype is trying to get users off of older versions of Skype. As part of that push, the Microsoft-owned company has sent out messages to users this week noting that it will be retiring a host of older iterations on July 1. Those who are still using them after that day will likely no longer be able to sign on. Skype app won't work on the follow OS versions: Android 4.0.2 and lower, BlackBerry OS 7.1 and lower, iOS 7 and lower, Linux (Linux users must upgrade to Skype for Linux Beta), Mac OS X 10.8 and lower, Symbian OS, Skype mobile for Verizon, Skype on 3, Skype on TV, Windows 10 task-based app, Windows Phone 8.1 and lower, and Windows RT. ( ) AT&T Uses Forced Arbitration To Overcharge Customers, Senators Say on June 09 '17 at 05:41 AM Slashdot's read-the-fine-print department : An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Five Democratic US senators allege that AT&T's use of forced arbitration clauses has helped the company charge higher prices than the ones it advertises to customers. The senators pointed to a CBS News investigation that described "more than 4,000 complaints against AT&T and [subsidiary] DirecTV related to deals, promotions and overcharging in the past two years." But customers have little recourse because they are forced to settle disputes with AT&T in arbitration, according to Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), and Edward Markey (D-Mass.). "Forced arbitration provisions in telecommunications contracts erode Americans' ability to seek justice in the courts by forcing them into a privatized system that is inherently biased in favor of providers and which offers virtually no way to challenge a biased outcome," the senators wrote in a letter yesterday to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson. "Forced arbitration requires consumers to sign away their constitutional right to hold providers accountable in court just to access modern-day essentials like mobile phone, Internet, and pay-TV services." Forced arbitration provisions such as AT&T's also "include a class action waiver; language which strips consumers of the right to band together with other consumers to challenge a provider's widespread wrongdoing," they wrote. ( ) on June 09 '17 at 03:00 AM Slashdot's friendly-fire department : MojoKid quotes a report from HotHardware: Qualcomm and Microsoft are on the verge of ushering in a new class of always-connected mobile devices that run full-blown Windows 10. The two are enabling ARM-based Snapdragon 835 processors to run Windows 10 with full x86 emulation, meaning that devices will be capable of not only running Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps from the Windows Store, but legacy win32 apps as well. There is little question, Intel is likely none too pleased with it and PC OEM heavyweights Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard and ASUS have also signed-on to deliver Windows 10 notebooks and 2-in-1 convertibles powered by Qualcomm. Until now, Intel sat by quietly while all of this unfolded, but the company today took the opportunity to get a bit passive-aggressive while announcing the fast-approaching 40th anniversary of the world's first x86 microprocessor. The majority of the press release reads like a trip down memory lane. However, Intel shifts into serious mama bear mode, with significant legal posturing, touting its willingness to protect its "x86 innovations." Intel goes on to say that Transmeta tried and ultimately failed in the marketplace, and has been dead and buried for a decade. The company then pivots, almost daring Microsoft and Qualcomm to challenge it by making Windows on ARM devices commercially available. "Only time will tell if new attempts to emulate Intel's x86 ISA will meet a different fate. Intel welcomes lawful competition... However, we do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights." ( ) on June 08 '17 at 11:00 PM Slashdot's election-results department : Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has lost her overall majority in Parliament on Thursday, plunging Britain into a period of renewed political chaos less than two weeks before it is scheduled to begin negotiations over withdrawing from the European Union. While May's Conservative party won the most seats, the party didn't win enough to govern without the support of minority parties. CNN reports: It was devastating result for May, who had called the election three years earlier than required by law, convinced by opinion polls that placed her far ahead of opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. The result also plunges Britain into a period of renewed political chaos, with Brexit talks likely to be delayed and May's personal authority shredded. There was already talk in Conservative circles that she might have to resign, less than a year after taking over from David Cameron, who resigned following the Brexit referendum. The pound fell on currency markets in the wake of the results. After the result was declared in her constituency of Maidenhead, May gave a faltering speech. "At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability," she said, suggesting she would attempt to form a government even if her party loses its majority. Corbyn said the early results showed May had lost her mandate and called for her to resign.

Whereas the previous models had soldered memory modules, the new iMac's memory sit in two removable SO-DIMM slots. MacRumors reports: iFixit made the discovery by disassembling Apple's $1,299 mid-range 3.0GHz stock option, which includes 8GB of 2400MHz DDR4 memory, a Radeon Pro 555 graphics card with 2GB of VRAM, and a 1TB 5400-RPM hard drive. After slicing through the adhesive that secures the 4K display to the iMac's housing and removing the power supply, hard drive, and fan, iFixit discovered that the memory modules aren't soldered onto the logic board like previous models, but instead sit in two removable SO-DIMM slots. Similarly, after detaching the heatsink and removing the warranty voiding stickers on the backside of the logic board, iFixit found that the Intel SR32W Core i5-7400 Kaby Lake processor sits in a standard LGA 1151 CPU socket, making it possible to replace or upgrade the CPU without a reflow station. ( ) Ask Slashdot: What Is Your View On Sloot Compression? on June 08 '17 at 05:41 PM Slashdot's lost-inventions department : An anonymous reader writes: A Dutch electronics engineer named Jan Sloot spent 20 years of his life trying to compress broadcast quality video down to kilobytes -- not megabytes or gigabytes (the link in this story contains an 11 minute mini-documentary on Sloot). His CODEC, finalized in the late 1990s, consisted of a massive 370Mb decoder engine that likely contained some kind of clever system for procedurally generating just about any video frame or audio sample desired -- fractals or other generative approaches may have been used by Sloot. The "instruction files" that told this decoder what kind of video frames, video motion and audio samples to generate were supposedly only kilobytes in size -- kind of like small MIDI files being able to generate hugely complex orchestral scores when they instruct a DAW software what to play. Jan Sloot died of a heart attack two days before he was due to sign a technology licensing deal with a major electronics company. The Sloot Video Compression system source code went missing after his death and was never recovered, prompting some to speculate that Jan Sloot was killed because his ultra-efficient video compression and transmission scheme threatened everyone profiting from storing, distributing and transmitting large amounts of digital video data. I found out about Sloot Compression only after watching some internet videos on "invention suppression." So the question is: is it technically possible that Sloot Compression, with its huge decoder file and tiny instruction files, actually worked? According to Reddit user PinGUY, the Sloot Digital Coding System may have been the inspiration for Pied Piper, a fictional data compression algorithm from HBO's Silicon Valley. Here's some more information about the Sloot Digital Coding System for those who are interested. ( ) Uber's Self-Driving Unit Gets New Head of Hardware After Levandowski Firing on June 08 '17 at 05:41 PM Slashdot's out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new department : A little more than a week ago, Uber fired Anthony Levandowski, the former head of its self-driving car project who is accused of stealing some 14,000 documents from Google's Waymo and using that information as the technological basis for Uber's self-driving cars. Uber is now appointing Brian Zajac as company's new head of hardware engineering. Gizmodo reports: Brian Zajac has worked at Uber since the early stages of its autonomous vehicle development in 2015, and previously developed robotic systems for the US Army and Shell Oil. He also contributed to research and development of a disaster-response robot at Carnegie Mellon University. (Uber poached extensively from the university to beef up its autonomous vehicle staff, though it's unclear whether Zajac's coming on board was part of that hiring spree.) With his promotion, Zajac will report directly to Eric Meyhofer, who took over Uber's Advanced Technologies Group after Uber fired ATG's former lead, Anthony Levandowski, for refusing to cooperate in a trade secret theft investigation. ( ) on June 08 '17 at 04:20 PM Slashdot's get-ready department : An anonymous reader quotes a report from VentureBeat: Google today launched the third Android O developer preview, available for download now at developer.android.com and via the Android Beta Program. The preview includes an updated SDK with system images for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, and the official Android Emulator, and there's even an emulator for testing Android Wear 2.0 on Android O. The big highlight with this preview is that the Android O APIs are now final. Google launched the first Android O developer preview in March and the second developer preview in May at its I/O 2017 developer conference. Google is planning to release one more preview with near-final system images in July and has slated the final version for release "later this summer" (in Q3 2017). Developer Preview 3 includes the latest version of the Android O platform with the final API level 26 and "hundreds of bug fixes and optimizations." ( ) Boeing Studies Planes Without Pilots, Plans Experiments Next Year on June 08 '17 at 04:20 PM Slashdot's not-too-distant-future department : "Boeing has begun researching the possibility of commercial-passenger jets that will fly without pilots, using artificial intelligence guiding automated controls to make decisions in flight," reports Seattle Times. The company is planning experimental flights, without passengers, for next year. From the report: "The basic building blocks of the technology are clearly available," said Mike Sinnett, former chief systems engineer on the 787 Dreamliner and now vice president at Boeing responsible for innovative future technologies, at a briefing before the Paris Air Show. "There's going to be a transition from the requirement to have a skilled aviator operate the airplane to having a system that operates the vehicle autonomously, if we can do that with the same level of safety," Sinnett said. Sinnett said Boeing's research is driven by the pilot shortage worldwide that is only going to become more acute. In the next two decades, Boeing forecasts a demand for about 40,000 new commercial jets, roughly doubling the world fleet. ( ) No Known Ransomware Works Against Windows 10 S, Says Microsoft on June 08 '17 at 03:00 PM Slashdot's comforting-news department : An anonymous reader shares a report: According to Microsoft, "no Windows 10 customers were known to be compromised by the recent WannaCry (WannaCrypt) global cyberattack." That's great news for anyone running the latest version of the OS, and the software giant says it is working to ensure Windows 10 remains safe from other future attacks. However, if you want to guarantee your safety from ransomware, then Microsoft points out there's an even more secure option to consider -- Windows 10 S. The new, hardened Windows 10 variant only runs apps from the Windows Store, which means it can't run programs from outside Microsoft's ecosystem, and that includes malware. Which is why, as Microsoft says, "No known ransomware works against Windows 10 S."

USA Today reports: "Amazon had the best deal in online storage -- unlimited backup for $59.99 -- but now unlimited is out. It has been replaced with tiered pricing, the system used by Amazon's rivals. The new rate, announced to customers Wednesday night, is now $59.99 yearly for 1 terabyte of online backup, with each additional terabyte (TB) costing an additional $59.99 annually. Additionally, Amazon is introducing a lower-priced tier set at 100 GBs of storage for $11.99 yearly." ( ) EU Seeks New Powers To Obtain Data 'Directly' From Tech Firms on June 08 '17 at 03:00 PM Slashdot's streamlined-access department : Zack Whittaker reports via ZDNet: European authorities are seeking new powers to allow police and intelligence agencies to directly obtain user data stored on the continent by U.S. tech companies. The move comes in the wake of an uptick in terrorist attacks, including several attacks in Britain and France, among others across the bloc. Tech companies have been asked to do more to help law enforcement, while police have long argued the process for gathering data overseas is slow and cumbersome. The bloc's justice commissioner, Vera Jourova, presented several plans to a meeting of justice ministers in Luxembourg on Thursday to speed up access for EU police forces to obtain evidence -- including one proposal to allow police to obtain data "directly" from the cloud servers of U.S. tech companies in urgent cases. "Commissioner Jourova presented at the Justice Council three legislative options to improve access to e-evidence," said Christian Wiga, an EU spokesperson, in an email. "Based on the discussion between justice ministers, the Commission will now prepare a legislative proposal," he added. Discussions are thought to have included what kind of data could be made available, ranging from geolocation data to the contents of private messages. Such powers would only be used in "emergency" situations, said Jourova, adding that safeguards would require police to ensure that each request is "necessary" and "proportionate." Further reading: Reuters ( ) on June 08 '17 at 01:40 PM Slashdot's tortoise-and-the-hare department : An anonymous reader quotes a report from DSLReports: The United States is 28th in terms of wireless broadband data speeds, according to the latest Akamai state of the internet report (pdf, hat tip ReCode). According to the data collected by the company, the United States average mobile broadband speed is now a not-entirely unrespectable 10.7 Mbps. But that speed pales in comparison to the top average speeds being seen in the UK (26 Mbps), Cyprus (24.2 Mbps), Germany (24.1 Mbps), and Finland (21.6 Mbps). The report is quick to note that US carrier efforts to boost speeds via next-generation broadband aren't quite as cutting edge as carrier marketing departments might have you believe. Many U.S. carriers have promised that their own fifth generation (5G) broadband deployments should deliver theoretical speeds up to 1 Gbps as well, but serious deployment isn't expected until 2020 or so. Some of this lagging can be explained away by the United States' mammoth geography, though some of it can also be explained by what, until recently, has been fairly muted but theatrical competition between major carriers.

Are You an Encourager? (Part 2) It's been said that Christianity is a relationship religion and that encouragement is the chief element in all good personal relationships. I believe that to be a true statement. Relationships require encouragement in order to be strong. When a couple is dating, for instance, there is typically a lot of encouragement flowing in both directions. However, if one is not careful, things will start being taken for granted. Relationships can continue without encouragement, but they won't be great relationships! Does God expect us to encourage each other? The Scriptures answer with a resounding "yes"! Paul stated in I Thessalonians 5:11 - "Therefore , just as you also are doing." Hebrews 3:13 teaches - "But , while it is called 'Today,' lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin." Hebrews 10:24,25 instructs - "And let us , not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but , and so much the more as you see the Day approaching." Elsewhere in God's word we see that the Lord commanded Moses to encourage Joshua as the baton of leadership was in the process of being passed - "Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift your eyes toward the west, the north, the south, and the east; behold it with your eyes, for you shall not cross over this Jordan. But command Joshua, and ; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you will see" (Deut. 3:27,28). Galatians 6:10 instructs Christians to "do good to all" as they have opportunity (certainly this would include encouraging). Becoming a more encouraging person is simply a matter of desire or choice, and dedication to that decision. In other words, it's a matter of attitude. We will have ups and downs in every aspect of our lives. Some days will be more encouraging than others, but we must strive to continually move in a more positive direction with the passing of time. Stock market investments provide a good illustration on this point. Although there will be some ups and downs on a regular basis, one expects to see positive growth and improvement over a span of time. One would be disappointed if his investment lost value over a long period of time. Likewise, God is certainly disappointed if His children fail to grow in a positive direction and become more encouraging. Are you a better encourager today than you were five years ago or have you become more negative or even cynical? Are you continually comforting and edifying others as you could (and should) be? Try to evaluate this as best you can (perhaps even ask your spouse or a close friend for an honest evaluation). Friends, may we delight in opportunities to give praise! We will continue this series in our next lesson.
Lessons from Joseph's Bones (Part 2) In our prior study, we learned the lesson of mortality from Joseph's bones. A related truth to understand is: 2. NO MAN IS INDISPENSABLE TO GOD'S PLAN. Joseph was valuable to God as a servant, but he was not indispensable. No one is indispensable or else God wouldn't let that person die (or leave this realm)! But, as we've already seen--all humans die eventually. Some people seem to act as if God couldn't make it without them, but that is simply not the case. As God said in Psalm 50:12 - "If I were hungry, I would not tell you; for the world is Mine, and all its fullness." God does not need us. He created everything, including us. He can take care of Himself ! Moses was an outstanding servant of God, but he eventually died and was replaced by Joshua. In other words, as valuable as he was, he also wasn't indispensable. Joshua 1:1,2 - "After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' assistant, saying: 'Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them - the children of Israel.'" David was an outstanding king of God's people, but he died and was replaced by Solomon; he was not indispensable either (cf. I Kings 2:10-12). There has only been one man who has ever walked on this Earth that has been indispensable in God's plan--Jesus the Christ! Acts 4:12 plainly declares - "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." God desires that man be saved, and the only way for it to happen was for Jesus to live sinlessly and die for the iniquities of the world. Jesus did that; He could not be replaced by anyone else! He was vital to God's plan, but we are not! The will of God will be accomplished whether we are here or not or whether we support it or not! After Joseph died, God's plan continued unfolding for the nation of Israel. God's plan did not die with Joseph or with the decomposing of his flesh. Today, salvation is only possible Jesus, and believing in Him is a requirement - "Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am He, you will die in your sins" (John 8:24). No one can be saved without faith in Jesus. No one can come to the Father except through Jesus. He is indispensable, but we aren't. As He said in John 14:6 - "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me." We will consider another truth we can learn from the bones of Joseph in our next lesson.

info@barbarastutman.com Born in Montreal, Barbara Stutman studied Fine Arts and Art History at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Saidye Bronfman Center and Concordia University. Although her paintings were included in several Canadian juried exhibitions, her love of jewellery led her to begin to study metalworking. The idea that she could design and make the pieces she wanted to wear proved irresistable and she has devoted herself to jewellery ever since, continuing her education with a variety of teachers in Canada, the United States and Europe. Early in her career her focus changed from creating jewellery designed specifically for adornment to more challenging pieces created to stimulate the mind as well as the eye. This development unfolded hand-in-hand with her decision to specialize in working metal wire using textile techniques such as weaving, knitting and crocheting. Stutman’s jewellery has been exhibited in galleries and museums throughout Canada, the United States, Europe and Asia and has been written about in newspapers, professional journals, catalogues and books. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec in Quebec City, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Koch Ring Collection in Switzerland and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City. Galerie Noël Guyomarc'h and in New York City at Charon Kransen Arts.

Search for: Even though engaged in meditation alone, this could include many things: breathing, a mantra, a picture. The basic thought is usually to Permit all your views converge on to that solitary level and sit there for as long as achievable. March 17, 2014 at 12:47 Obtaining began my spiritual "quest" by prayer and in a spot of deep introspection and all of the applications available to me,I launched into a journey of meditation.Getting a "layman",It absolutely was fraught While using the Predicament of quietening my thoughts even though protecting "the posture".With perseverance and ,immediately after abondoning my so identified as "Predicament" I skilled "one thing" I realised I had to be as comfortable as feasible by my expectations.I opted to your meditative practise,lying down!Compensated no attention to my views and centered on my breath! These states are already referred to as by some theologians as “infused contemplation”, “higher contemplation”, “intuitive contemplation”. It is actually: “a supernatural gift by which anyone’s brain and may develop into thoroughly centered on God. It's a kind of mystical union with God, a union characterised by The point that it is God, and God only, who manifests himself. Underneath this affect of God, which assumes the absolutely free cooperation in the human will, the intellect receives Specific insights into matters from the spirit, plus the affections are extraordinarily animated with divine really like. Per the Oxford Dictionary of Globe Religions, “prayer” is “the relating of the self or soul to God in rely on, penitence, praise, petition, and reason, possibly separately or corporately” and “meditation” is “a kind of mental prayer.” Bahá'u'lláh says there is a signal (from God) in each and every phenomenon: the sign with the intellect is contemplation along with the indication of contemplation is silence, since it is unachievable for a man to perform two items at a single time – he can not both of those speak and meditate. This illumination would expose that the difference between prayer and meditation is prayer is Talking our need though meditation is listening for the answer. As prayer deepens and we become transformed the Holy Spirit prompts us from inside to virtuous actions. In Teresa’s Way of Perfection, Chapter 16 in speaking of contemplation she reminds us that God doesn’t give Himself but to people that give themselves fully to Him. There is not any area in this article for inordinate self-really like. For ten to thirty minutes, repeat the sacred word. It should be recurring don't just mechanically, but with aim and emotional articles. Every repetition needs to be like a prayer. There’s little question that meditation can be a self-discipline that enhances one particular’s capability to concentration and concentrate. It’s also been medically tested to cut back strain and ease some physical ailments. Nonetheless, those training prayer attain these same Bodily benefits and also financial gain spiritually. While the goal of meditation involves longevity, pleasure, and assurance, the peril of this type of self-aim is the fact that it can result in an at any time-increasing ego as opposed to providing a pathway to increased humility and enjoy. One more elaborate and State-of-the-art kind of contemplative examining, that consists of vizualization exercise routines, is the Spiritual Exercise routines of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. All the knowledge can take about thirty days and infrequently will involve a each day interview with a spiritual director. The procedure starts using a thought of the purpose of one particular’s daily life and the relationship with the remainder of development. Contemplative prayer, as a result, isn't going to belong to the privileged handful of. It can be a traditional typical practical experience in the Christian daily life open up to all. contemplative prayer — which usually consists of the silent repetition of sacred terms or sentences, with aim and devotion In discursive contemplation, thoughts and imagination and other faculties are actively employed in order to understand our relationship with God. In silent contemplation, this exercise is curtailed, to make sure that contemplation has been called “a gaze of faith”, or “a silent appreciate”. “Buddhism is witnessed as the organic residence of contemplation when Christian prayer is considered by lots of to concentration almost completely on intercession, confession and praise – all three really wordy ways of praying.

A Dance to the Music of Time; First Movement University of Chicago Press, 1995.  First published in England. Review published Sep 2017. We open with Nick Jenkins who is in his last year of school.  His closest friends (a group which adds and subtracts characters from time to time) are headed in slightly different directions, all intending to make their way in finance, art, or social circles in the highly stratified society of the 1920s and 1930s.  One of the more odd young men, Kenneth Widmerpool, reappears from time to time and we grow to appreciate him; Stringham, who at the beginning seemed to be the most likely to succeed, seems to lose his way along the line. Jenkins, a writer who finds work in an art publications house, appears to be a passive observer, as a first-person narrator he seems at first to be an empty vessel, but we learn that his observations are pretty acute.  Even people observed from a distance, like professors and elders, or politically different types like Gypsy and her mates, are sharply drawn. Vivid, often funny, slow moving but a thorough portrait of the times, it reminded me of Proust; others have mentioned that as well. I'm not sure I'll read the rest (it is, after all, twelve novels marketed in four trilogies) but I did enjoy my ride so far.
by Cliff McKenzie, editor, vigilancevoice.com                   ZERO PLUS 1267 DAY-- New York, NY, Sunday, March                    2, 2005-                   the bigger scope of things today, one doesn't think of a toilet                    as a potential Terrorist. Not, that is, until its contents overflows                    from the apartment above upon you and all your bathroom belongings.                   from a deep sleep by an incessant ringing of the doorbell. I                    knew it wasn't the police because they bang and yell. Struggling                    to get clothes on, I heard my wife asking who was there. "Toilet                          ... is ... okay?? Is ... not okay??"                   and huffed into our hallway. He's far too old to be tromping                    up fifty nine stairs--the elevation to our fifth-floor apartment--especially                    at nearly 2 a.m. "Toilet......is                    okay?....is not okay?" Joseph is Ukrainian.                    Where we live in the East Village, the street is mostly Ukrainian                    rooted. Things have changed over the years, but the "old                    school" still has a firm grip on the block. Just a block                    west of us is a huge Ukrainian church. Across the street are                    Ukrainian travel agencies, and around the corner a Ukrainian                    butcher and several Ukrainian restaurants.. "Aiyyyy...yeiiiii...yeiiii..."                   the raining water sieving down from above into our bathroom.                    leak more than a year, or was it two, earlier? Time slips by                    flush by flush. "It go three floors....aiyyyy...yieeee...yieee..."                    And out the door hobbled Josef with his flashlight. Now, I have this aversion                    bathroom. You just don't know what it contains.                   aching because its more than 100 years old, you just don't expect                    the plumbing to be that modern, and, you tolerate the fact that                    like the United States, there may not be a lot of funds to retrofit                    the infrastructure. Thus, when something goes awry, there's                    a chance the whole building could collapse.                         a toilet screams in NYC it's a part of life Three years ago our daughter's                    apartment building was threatened with extinction. Butted next                    statues, the owner of the building decided to remodel it without                    seeking building permits. Seems he was knocking down a wall                    without reinforcing the beams, and, because of the weight of                    his statues, the whole building began to crumble.                   the East Village doesn't exceed five stories because the structures                    were made out of brick. Brick can only safely handle about five                    stories. Only when steel was introduced could buildings soar                    toward the underbelly of the sky. Bricks had limitations. My daughter's apartment                    was brick. So was the one that crumbled. There were a few days                    one to see if, because everything was so close and seemed to                    lean on every other building, there was any major structural                    damage. She moved back in, only                    behind her wasn't there any more.                   and water showers down, if you're schooled in New York City                    Village life, you don't jump up and scream. It's part of life.                         our toilet crisis ...I got out the umbrellas... But that doesn't make                    it less Terrorizing. In Israel, suicide bombers are part of                    life but that doesn't make one leap with joy when a bomb goes                    off. In Baghdad shooting judges and lawyers defending Saddam                    Hussein seems to be as common as picking one's teeth with the                    pin of a hand grenade, but again, there isn't dancing in the                    streets over such a death unless you're on the side of the "bad                    guy." It can be said, then,                    that last night, half naked, drowzy, afflicted by hay fever,                    water from the toilet above.                   a crisis? You think smart. I did.                    I got out the umbrellas.                   stores on shelves wouldn't get ruined. That includes the shavers                    and curling irons and hair dryers and other electrical items.                   to safety, thinking of uccky toilet water from some unknown                    source and mixed with unknown germs, dropping on the cloth one                    dries one's sacred flesh with, and the idea of the unknown made                    my pores pucker. Unable to sleep, I waited                    around until all the water stopped dripping. Then I scoured                    the bathroom with Lysol, cleaned up all the "germs"                    as best I could and sat waiting for the ceiling to collapse,                    to boil, or, peer dully into the neck of an hourglass watching                    of eternity was a few grains away.                   a toilet bowl, I couldn't go back to sleep. But I wondered--just                    how many toilets are there? ...and set  It's hard to get an accurate                    were locked down. To get info, you had to have a password. Still, I know there are                    some 100 million households in America, and odds are that there                    is at least one toilet in each. Sixty million are owner-occupied,                    so odds are they have at least two or more. That pushes us upwards                    of 200 million toilets. Now, there are buildings--offices,                    hotels, motels, McDonalds, Starbucks--for another 100 million                    potential toilets. Dollarwise, the paper  $9  in sales last year. The entire sanitary distributor                    system topped nearly $20 billion. In other words, there's                    an increase in wiping and flushing. But there's a ton of                    in the pre-dawn with an umbrella to keep the neighbor's toilet                    water from dripping on my head. a toilet each day, and how much of our lives are spent on the                    "can." It seems we spend about 2,500 hours on the                    toilet during our lifetime, and make six to seven trips a day                    to its "throne."                   a toilet is until we don't have one. , 1836-1910, has been credited with being                    our first 'sanitary pioneer'. He constructed the first indoor                    toilet --- hence, the term 'crapper'. ( ) There's also a website                    on an international basis. Seems there's a "world                    toilet watch"                   anywhere in the world, including pictures, for those who like                    to really plan their travel.                   that help you keep track of flushings and the history of toilets,                    including toilet paper. Seems a man named Scott developed the                    first toilet roll, but the innovation of the human mind was                    way ahead of the curve.                   rich used expensive linen attached to a stick to wipe themselves,                    and on a more crude side, sailors at sea prior to toilet paper                    used the hemp anchor line to remove waste from their bottoms.                   to a bathroom free from drips. However, there is an odd smell                    lingering.                   wood absorbed the toilet water, so we are spraying the bathroom                    air to perhaps remove the tell-tale odor. There is, too, that lingering                    booby-trap danger.                       Crapper has been credited with being the first 'sanitary                        pioneer' Like any terror-riddled                    nation, a bathroom that has been under toilet overflow attack                    may have dangerous munitions still armed. Above, hidden behind                    the ceiling, may be pockets of toilet water, and, god knows,                    through the cracks and crevices of the neighbor's floors. I am prepared. I have                    my umbrellas at the ready. I have the Lysol poised.                   of Toilet Vigilance.

It has been lingering into November in recent years, as well as  arriving earlier.  Its annual immigration into our area, beginning at least  by July but sometimes earlier, has been known from at least the mid-19th century. Thaddeus W. Harris  was the first to report this  species in Massachusetts; he found one in a meadow in Milton on August 19, 1827;  (Harris 1862: 293; ).  Frank H. Sprague wrote in 1878 that he  had taken "a number of specimens" in the last three years in the Wollaston  (now Quincy) area; in fact, he took 7 specimens there in 1876, 1877 and 1878, as  well as one in Granby in western Massachusetts in August 1878 (Sprague 1879a,  1879b; MCZ specimens). Photo:  Northampton  Community Gardens,  Frank  Model,  August 10, 2010 New England."  In addition to Harris' and Sprague's sites, Scudder  been found, including Springfield, Amherst, Boston, Malden, Jamaica Plain,  Natick, Weston, Newton, Taunton, Cape Cod, and "western Massachusetts."    All were seen between July and September.  Prof. H. W. Parker took one and saw others on  roads in Amherst in 1874, and A. H.  Clark found it in Newtonville in 1895 or 1896  (Scudder 1889: 499; Parker 1874; Clark  1913). The Denton Brothers captured at least one in Wellesley in 1896 (MCZ  Denton mount collection). reported in the early literature, probably because it was an interesting  butterfly to collectors. A "novelty," as Parker put it (Parker 1874). By the mid-1930’s Farquhar lists more locations  where Common Buckeye had been found: Sharon, West Roxbury, Cohasset, West  Gloucester, Rowley, Cambridge, Essex, and Woods Hole. Root adds North Andover in  1945 (Farquhar 1934; Clark 1925; Root and Farquhar 1948). southeastern Massachusetts in the fall of 1945, when “over 100 at once” were  reported along the coast (Cassie, MAS Atlas). That year W. P. Rogers collected four specimens  at Westport in September, and two more in October.  He also found one at  Westport in October 1939 (Yale Peabody Museum). Vladimir Nabokov and his  son Dmitri collected two in Wellesley in July and August 1945 (MCZ). C. P. Kimball reported it as "rare" on Nantucket in the  1930's; however there are four historic specimens (n.d.) in the Maria Mitchell  Museum today (pers. comm. and photos, 9/2011, E. LoPresti).  F. M. Jones  found it "usually present in the late season" on Martha's Vineyard.   Mid-July was the earliest it arrived on the islands (Jones and Kimball 1943).  Jones' specimen from August 21, 1945 is in the Yale Peabody Museum. Both historically and today, Common Buckeye is a regular  summer and fall immigrant into Massachusetts, but it cannot survive winters here  so far as is known. It re-populates southern New England each year from larger  populations further south, and is able to produce one or more generations here,  depending on the date of arrival.  Warm springs allow earlier arrivals. The  numbers arriving each year are variable; 1990 and 1994 were relatively large  flight years, with the species arriving in June (Cassie, MAS Atlas). In broods emerging in the fall, the under hind wing is rose-colored (extreme is form "rosa") rather  than tan; rose-colored fall individuals have been photographed in Massachusetts, for example  by Barbara Spencer in Cummington on August 23, 2004: http://www.pbase.com/barbaraspencer/image/138410202 . Common Buckeye ranges quite far south in the Americas, to  southern Mexico, Cuba and the Bahamas, and uses different host plants in  different regions. Most host plants are in the (snapdragon) or (plantain) families.  In New England and  the mid-Atlantic, the most common host plant for the summer brood in the  nineteenth century was probably purple gerardia ( ). Linn. one of the Scrophulariaceae....(1889: 500).”  In  1893 Mrs. William Starr Dana wrote in  her popular book “the low-lying ground along the coast and in the neighborhood of the Great  Lakes. The sandy fields of New England and Long Island are oftentimes a vivid  mass of color owing to their delicate blossoms.” And the little seaside gerardia, G. maritime, enlivened the salt marshes (1989 edition: 200). Today, lacking such an abundance of gerardia, Common  Plantago lanceolata, or lance-leaved plantain, a widespread non-native weed introduced with the  arrival of European settlers.  The 1990-95  Connecticut Atlas workers observed Buckeye ovipositing on lance-leaved plantain  in the wild, and the caterpillars have been successfully raised on it many  times, for example by caterpillar photographer Sam Jaffe in July 2011.  Buckeyes  have been observed in the wild ovipositing on the native purslane speedwell ( ) (S. Jaffe 6/21/2011), and on the non-native butter-and-eggs ( ) (M. Champagne 7/14/2008).  They are also reported to use blue  toadflax ( Linaria canadensis), slender gerardia ( ),  and sometimes  non-native garden snapdragons ( )  (Scott 1986). Common Buckeye thus uses both native and introduced plants.  It is listed among the Switchers ( ),  having added the non-native hosts such as plantain to its original native  hosts. elevations, with some bare soil.  It is frequently found basking in patches  of bare soil, such as dirt roads, sandy beaches, and clearings under power  lines.  Its host plants, however, often prefer moist to average soil, so  bare soil.  Common Buckeye adapts to disturbed areas, and can be found breeding  in weedy vacant lots and edges of plowed fields. 1600-1850 in New England undoubtedly increased habitat for Common Buckeye, as it  did for many other butterflies ( ). But  as with our other seasonal immigrant species, overall abundance in this region  depends on climate and other factors in the southern part of its range, as  well as here. Common Buckeye ranks as an “Uncommon-to-Common” butterfly  in the state,  according to 2000-2007 MBC records ( ).  The 1986-90 MAS Atlas also ranked it as uncommon-to-common, so  there was not a major change in status over those 15 or so years. Chart 58:  MBC Sightings per Total Trip  Reports, 1993-2009 the numbers of Common Buckeyes seen per number of trip reports 1993-2009. Nor did a list-length study  of the same MBC data find any strong pattern of change 1992-2010 for this  species (Breed et al. 2012).  But there is a marked  pattern of alternate year fluctuation, with a good flight year usually being  followed by a poor flight year, which is then followed by another good flight  year. In good flight years, Buckeyes are usually seen early in the season, in  June or even May or April. 2009, for example, was a poor arrival year, the first  Buckeye not being seen until 7/12/2009 on the Blackstone Valley NABA Count. In  contrast, 2010 was a year of numerous Buckeye sightings, with the first one  reported  on 5/13 (Foxboro, M. Champagne).  2011 and 2012 continued  the upward trend of sightings, with the first arrivals coming as early as  4/29/2011 and 4/21/2012 (see below). across the state were added in those two years, and fresh individuals were reported,  especially in plantain fields, into September. But then 2013 was a poor year for  Buckeye sightings. Common Buckeye sightings, but the reading shown on Chart 58 may be somewhat misleading. The Westport/South  reliably seen in fall in double-digit numbers. In 2000 multiple visits were made  to this area by many different observers, as part of a migration study, and all  observers submitted large counts of Common Buckeyes, and there may have been  some duplicate counting.  In preceding and subsequent years there were many  fewer trips to this area. 2000 was an abundant flight year for this species, but  suggest. Between 1993 and 2013, Common Buckeye was reported from 125  of the 315 towns in Massachusetts (Map 58).  Twenty-eight  new towns were added  in 2010-2013 alone.   Sightings are distributed  across the entire state, including Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket,  Connecticut River valley.  In this area, many of the sightings shown were  added only in the recent banner years of 2011 and 2012 (e.g. Lenox, Sheffield,  Cheshire and Williamstown). Map 58: BOM-MBC Sightings by Town, 1993-2013 Compared to the 1986-90 MAS Atlas map, the  BOM-MBC map shows  many more reports from Franklin County, northern Worcester County, and the  Connecticut River valley.  Having more observers in the  field for a longer time is probably the reason, but there may also have been a real increase in the  numbers of Common Buckeyes in those areas. Common Buckeye is less often found at higher elevations,  and has only occasionally been reported from the long-running Northern Berkshire  (since 1993), Central Berkshire (since 1987), and Central Franklin (since 1990) NABA Counts. It had never been reported on the Southern Berkshire (since 1993)  NABA Count until 2011. Franklin Counties in 2010 and 2011 (good years overall for Buckeye in the  state).  In 2011 the Central Franklin Count had 5 on 7/4/2011, the highest  number ever for that count, and singles were found on the Northern Berkshire  Count 7/9/2011, the Central Berkshire Count 7/16/2011, and the Southern  Berkshire Count 7/8/2011. F. Model reported a Buckeye from Lenox (Berkshire  Co.) on the early date of 5/12/2011.  And in high-elevation Williamstown  (northwest Berkshire Co.), 4 Buckeyes were reported from two different locations  in 2011. Local reporter Pam Weatherbee said it was the “first time I’ve seen it here” (masslep 7/13/2011). Although Common Buckeye was historically reported as "rare"  on Nantucket (see above), it may be becoming less so. In BOM-MBC records are  sight reports of  2 in 2006 S. Perkins; 7 in 2011 E. Haugh; 2 in 2011 E.  LoPresti; 1 in 2012 V. Laux (photo); and 3 in 2013 M. Pelikan.  Some  believe it may overwinter (LoPresti 2011). The Martha's Vineyard checklist ranks  Common Buckeye as "common in late summer" (Pelikan 2002), and there  are many BOM-MBC records. concentrations, except at fall migration gathering points along the coast such  as Gooseberry Neck and associated areas in Westport/south Dartmouth. Aside from  this area, the overwhelming majority of reports is of one or two individuals at  a location. Specific locations from which larger numbers have been reported are Neck 51 on 9/18/2000 B.

In the 1986-90  Atlas, B. Cassie reports two “breeding colonies” seen in 1990, 80 in Falmouth (n.d.)  and 21 in Westford (9/4/1990).  No such large late summer colonies have  been reported since then, but they may not have been looked for or recognised. mid-June through early November, according to 1992-2007 MBC records, with a very  few sightings being reported in May (and now April) ( http://www.naba.org/chapters/nabambc/flight-dates-chart.asp ).   The earlier sightings are all presumably new arrivals, since the species has not  been shown to over-winter here, even on the southern islands.  However, females  have been observed laying eggs, and at least one generation  probably matures in Massachusetts. The Common Buckeye life cycle takes about 25  to 45 days from egg to adult, so an early June arrival would allow for two  generations. The largest number of individuals reported is in September.  Late  fall (September-October) sightings are most numerous at coastal locations, since  Common Buckeyes normally undertake a return migration south. :  In the 21 years of BOM-MBC  records 1993-2013, the four earliest "first sightings" are 4/21/2012 Medford  Middlesex Fells, M. Arey;  4/29/2011, Chicopee Westover Air Base, S. Stichter .; 5/13/2010 Foxboro, M. Champagne; and 5/16/2000 Wenham, F. Goodwin.   The three earliest sightings have been in the last three years. The very warm  springs in the northeast in 2010 and 2012, along with a particularly warm day in  a southern location in 2011, provide at least some of the explanation. Further  analysis is needed, but there may be a trend toward earlier sightings of this  species. Other than these four early years, there were eight years  in which the earliest sighting was in June, and nine years in which it was July  or later. In all these years there were many skilled observers in the field  beginning in spring, but Common Buckeye was not seen.  It seems safe to  it to Massachusetts until very late in the season, and other years in which at  least a few were quite early. Scudder, who synthesized what was known about  century, wrote that the “earliest  recorded capture” in New England was July 18 (1899: 501).  The numerous  June and early July sightings today strongly suggest arriving here earlier than it did in the late 1800’s. would make two broods possible, whereas  century there was probably only one.  Scudder wrote that  since there were no signs whatever of a spring brood in New England, it was most  further south, and that the September brood was the only one born in New  England, except possibly in the southernmost locations (1899: 501). :  In the same 21-year time  period, the four latest "last sightings" in BOM-MBC records are 11/10/2012  Fairhaven, M. Lynch and S. Carroll; 11/7/2008  Edgartown Katama Plains, M. Pelikan; 11/6/2004 Chilmark, A. Keith; and 11/4/2000  Edgartown Katama Plains, M. Pelikan.  Almost all of the late and last  sightings occur on Martha’s Vineyard or along the southern coast , for example  at Westport/south Dartmouth (Gooseberry Neck). In 19 of the 21 years 1993-2013, the last  sightings of Buckeyes have been in October or November, rather than September.  Scudder makes no mention of any October or November sightings or specimens, suggesting that  ago. In the mid-1980’s, it was accepted that Common Buckeye survived the winter only as far north as the  coastal dunes of North Carolina (Opler and  Krizek 1984: 162).  While its range of full-time residency might  be expected to move north somewhat in response to global climate warming, there  is still no evidence that it over-winters in either the mid-Atlantic or New  England states.  However, the numbers emigrating northward, and the number and  success of the generations raised in New England, may be expected to increase  with climate warming ( ). Preservation of open, rural habitat will benefit this  species, which will make use of farm fields and waste areas, as well as less  disturbed habitat. Common Buckeye’s conservation status is S5 or Secure throughout  most of its range (NatureServe 7/2011). Unless there is major habitat loss  further south, numbers of Common Buckeyes in New England, and their length of  time here, may be expected to increase in coming years. © Sharon Stichter 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 page updated  1-22-2014

LifeTips is the place to go when you need to know about Kitchen Style & Decorating Ideas and other Cabinet topics. How do I choose a color scheme for my kitchen? If you are remodeling your kitchen, it's likely you are bored with its current color scheme. But how do you choose a new one that will work? There's no rule that says you have to choose your color first or your cabinets first. If you aren't sure about color, you can focus in other areas while you decide. Some colors will work better with some cabinetry finishes and wood choices. If you choose cherry or mahogany cabinetry, a dark red or brown color might create an uninviting space. If you choose lighter, maple cabinets, too bold a color -- like a cobalt blue -- will likely overpower them. Some color schemes in the kitchen work with a certain style. For example, French Country cabinetry is often paired with greens, yellows and oranges. If you decide to mix two or three colors, be careful, especially with painting walls. If you mix colors that are not of the same palette, it could clash. You can find out about color palettes from a kitchen designer or a paint expert. If you are simply unsure of what color scheme to choose for your new kitchen, look to home magazines, home decor shows and even TV commercials as they are likely to showcase current popular color trends. Or, find a decor item that you love and take your lead from that. In the end, pick a color or colors that match your personality. Before you paint any walls in your kitchen, take paint samples home and tape them to the walls. Look at them in a variety of light, and leave them up long enough to know if you really like them.

1-on-1 Comparison 10 MP | Four Thirds (17.3 x 13 mm) CMOS Sensor $2,397.99 4% 26 MP | Full frame (35.9 x 24 mm) CMOS Sensor $1,899.00 5% Here we are comparing  two cameras with different body types: Panasonic GH5S is a camera with a 10.0MP Four Thirds sensor whereas Canon 6D MII is a Semi-Pro DSLR camera with a 26.0MP Full frame sensor. Despite some fundamental differences of these two body types, Mirrorless cameras are becoming serious altenatives to DSLR cameras thanks to their size/weight advantages and recent improvements in their focus speeds , which makes this comparison even more interesting. Let's have a brief look at the main features of Panasonic GH5S and Canon 6D MII before getting into our more detailed comparison. Announcement Date: 2018-01-08 10MP - Four Thirds CMOS Sensor No Anti-aliasing (AA) filter ISO 160 - 51200 3.2" Fully Articulated Screen 12.0 fps continuous shooting Built-in Wireless 660g. 139 x 98 x 87 mm Announcement Date: 2017-06-29 26MP - Full frame CMOS Sensor ISO 100 - 40000 ( expands to 50-102400) Optical (pentaprism) viewfinder 6.5 fps continuous shooting Built-in Wireless Built-in GPS 765g. 144 x 111 x 75 mm 51.200 40.000 28% higher Max ISO 3.2" 0.2 inches larger display 1.620k dots 1.040k dots 55% higher resolution screen 100% 98% 1/8000s 1/4000s 12.0fps 6.5fps 5.5 fps faster Connect off-camera flash 160% more pixels 33.19 22.14 49% larger pixel area $1,899 $2,398 $499 cheaper Autofocus at f/8 aperture Yes (Electronic) Yes (Optical) 12.0fps 6.5fps UHS-II UHS-I Read/Write in Ultra High Speeds No Built-in stabilization Built-in Flash Below you can see the front view size comparison of Panasonic GH5S and Canon 6D MII.            Panasonic GH5S is 5mm narrower and 13mm shorter than Canon 6D MII but it is also 12mm thicker. Now lets look at the top view comparison of Panasonic GH5S and Canon 6D MII. Weight is another important factor especially when deciding on a camera that you want to carry with you all day.                 Panasonic GH5S is 105g lighter  than the Canon 6D MII but we don't think this will make a significant difference. Also keep in mind that body weight is not the only deciding factor when comparing two interchangeable camera bodies, you have to also take into account the lenses that you will be using with these bodies. Since Canon 6D MII has a Full frame sensor and Panasonic GH5S has a smaller Four Thirds sensor, Panasonic GH5S's lenses for a similar focal length and aperture will generally be lighter and smaller than the Canon 6D MII lenses. Panasonic GH5S has a 10.0MP Four Thirds (17.3 x 13 mm ) sized CMOS sensor  and features Venus Engine 10 processor. On the other hand, Canon 6D MII has a 26.0MP Full frame (35.9 x 24 mm ) sized CMOS sensor  and features DIGIC 7 processor. Canon 6D MII's sensor provides 16MP more than Panasonic GH5S's sensor, which gives a significant advantage in real life. You can print your images larger or crop more freely.             On the other hand, please keep in mind that Max sensor resolution is not the only determinant of resolving power. Factors such as the optical elements, low pass filter, pixel size and sensor technology also affects the final resolution of the captured image. Another difference between these two cameras is that Panasonic GH5S's sensor lacks anti-alias (Low-Pass) filter. Removing anti-alias filter increases the sharpness and level of detail but at the same time, it increases the chance of  moire occurring in certain scenes. Below you can see the GH5S and 6D MII sensor size comparison. As seen above, Canon 6D MII has a 3.8x Larger sensor area than Panasonic GH5S. Larger sensors give photographer more control on the depth of field and blurry background compared to smaller sensor when shot in same focal length and aperture. In this section, we rank and compare Panasonic GH5S and Canon 6D MII for five different photography types in order to make your decision process easier in case you are specifically interested in one or more of these areas.

When we look at the available lenses for these two cameras, we see that Canon 6D MII has an advantage over Panasonic GH5S There are 251 lenses for Canon 6D MII's Canon EF mount, on the other hand there are only 92 lenses for Panasonic GH5S's Micro Four Thirds lens mount. Another important factor is the availability of image stabilization.  None of these bodies have sensor based image stabilization so you have to buy lenses with Optical stabilization feature.

Cameron support helps to establish new girls' handball club Site managers are two of the best! 16/06/2017 Two of Cameron’s site managers have been named as some of the best in the building business. Pete Jones, who manages the Bourne Fields development in Aldridge and Lewis Brazier, who manages Keepers Cross in Tividale, are included in this year’s list of top site managers, compiled by the National House Builders Federation as part of its ‘Pride in the Job’ programme. They are amongst only 450 people to win one of the coveted quality awards, from around 16,000 site managers across the UK. Paul Morrissey, chief operations officer Cameron, said: “I am delighted that Pete and Lewis have been chosen to receive the accolade. “They have worked extremely hard developing their teams to not only reach but to maintain the required standards. A lot of hard work goes into the preparation for this award by all supporting staff and sub contractors. They have to go through several rounds of rigorous inspections at various stages of the developments being built. “The achievements are well-deserved and reflect the high quality of construction at our sites – it is good news for Pete and Lewis and our customers at Bourne Fields and Keepers Cross.” The Pride in the Job programme has been running for almost 40 years and the two winners from Cameron will now go on to compete for a higher level award at a National House Building Council dinner this autumn.

TABU: A STORY OF THE SOUTH SEAS , the third of the recent batch of of Masters of Cinema Blu-ray upgrades of previous DVD releases. Slarek celebrates a great but seemingly unlikely cinematic collaboration. Tabu: A Story of the South Seas I was surprised in a way that rather neatly exposed my own oddly formed preconceptions about filmmakers and the films they choose to make. What caught me out was the idea that two directors as seemingly diverse as F.W. Murnau and Robert Flaherty would unite on a single project. But why in hell not? Both were acknowledged masters of their craft and doubtless had a healthy respect for each other's work, and what filmmaker would not want to collaborate with someone whose work they admire, no matter how great their own personal standing? It later occurred to me that the source of my surprise lay in part with a buried tendency to associate a particular filmmaker with the first film of theirs that I saw, which painted an initial picture in my head of (thinking about it now, that sounds like a film I'd happily pay to see). But there's logic behind this foolishness. Flaherty was primarily a maker of ethnographic documentaries, while Murnau was a creator of strikingly inventive dramatic works. On paper this makes them seem more like opponents than a ideal partners on a feature of any description. But both men were genuine pioneers in their chosen fields and the project was apparently one Murnau had cherished for years. And given the strong ethnographic element to the story, who better collaborate with than Flaherty? That the two quickly fell out is perhaps unsurprising given that they were both men of vision with strongly held notions of the form their films should take, and stories suggest Murnau was not one easily given to compromise. It's thus Murnau who ended up in the director's chair and he who has ended up with the lion's share of the credit for what really is an extraordinary film. As with the other two recent Blu-ray re-releases from Masters of Cinema, , I've already covered the film itself in the earlier DVD review, which you can read . The main issue facing this Blu-ray upgrade of the 2008 Masters of Cinema DVD is that the earlier transfer was so damned good that it seemingly left little room for improvement. Obviously if you have a top-of-the-range 100-inch HD screen then you're quickly going to notice a difference between a PAL transfer sourced from an HD master and a 1080p HD transfer, but on a smaller screen, coupled with a player good upscaling capabilities, the difference is likely to seem less dramatic. But make a side-by-side comparison between the two discs and the differences are immediately apparent, not just in the increased level of fine detail but in the subtleties of the contrast range. Also more visible here is the film grain, and while some non-purists might see this as a fault, for those of us who shudder and the negative effects of digital noise reduction, the grain is as much part of the picture as its tonal range. The transfer has been sourced from the same Murnau-Stiftung / Luciano Berriatúa 75th anniversary restoration as the previous DVD transfer and the incidents of remaining damage are thus identical on both discs, though have been brought into sharper focus by the increase in resolution here, a small price to pay for an otherwise fine transfer of a film of this age and importance. A key difference of the new transfer is that it has restored the film's original aspect ratio of 1.19:1, compared to the 1.37:1 of the previous DVD release, which results in markedly more picture information at the top and bottom of screen (see frame grabs below). The new 1.19:1 Blu-ray transfer (above) compared to the 1.37:1 DVD transfer (below) The Linear PCM 48 mono 2.0 soundtrack displays, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same strengths and restrictions as the Dolby mono track on the DVD, which is no bad thing for one of the earliest synchronised music tracks in cinema history. Full marks to Masters of Cinema for not commissioning a re-recording of the track, which  would have dramatically boosted the dynamic range but would be inauthentic to the film as it was originally screened. Two (well, three) of the extra features included here been ported over from the earlier DVD release, but that's no bad thing at all, particularly as they have been expanded on for this edition. Some of the comments below have thus been reproduced from those on my original DVD review, with a couple minor amendments where appropriate. Commentary by R. Dixon Smith and Brad Stevens One of those expert commentaries that it would be terribly easy to be cynical about, particularly  the way  Smith and Stevens discuss motifs and meanings that you can't initially help thinking were probably more the result of logic or coincidence than planning (Hitu's slow movement, for instance, could be passed off as a common trait of characters in positions of authority), but their arguments become increasingly persuasive as the film progresses and some of those motifs are repeated with obvious purpose. They provide useful detail on the material cut or altered for the Paramount and Samuel Brown versions and are clearly huge admirers of a film they regard as Murnau's masterpiece. (14:53) A documentary made by Luciano Berriatúa as part of the series for F.W. Murnau-Stiftung that kicked off with the one you'll find on the Masters of Cinema DVD. Although considerably shorter than its predecessor, the programme is busy with useful material, including the Murnau/Walter Spies concept of 'architectural cinematography', a side-by-side compassion of two angles of the same shots, and footage not used in the film that was recycled by Murnau's brother Robert Plumpe for his own short films. The included extracts from the feature give you a good idea how it looked before the Murnau-Stiftung restoration. (15:26) Not the usual collection of cut sequences, but a short documentary in which they are showcased,with alternative takes of individual sequences compared (including a dance sequence in which the female dancers are alternately bare-chested and covered up to avoid American censorship) and all of the angles of others are run one in sequence. A commentary (in German with English subtitles) provides a detailed explanation of what we are watching and also covers details about the technical aspects of the shoot and film processing. Usefully, we are informed whether footage was shot by Robert Flaherty or Floyd Crosby – so close are they stylistically that you'd be pushed to work it out otherwise. A fascinating piece. Treibjagd in der Südsee (Dive Hunting in the South Seas) (11:34) A short film constructed in 1940 from footage unused by Murnau showing a manner of fishing specific to this South Sea Island where if a shoal of fish swims into the bay, almost everyone in the community rush into the sea, seal off the bay, drive the fish towards the shore and kill them with spears. Excitingly edited and scored and peppered with unexpected cutaways, usually involving children, who catch a turtle, hang on to the back of a speeding boat and, more alarmingly, get run over by a canoe and clobbered in the face with an oar. At first glance the booklet looks to be the same as the one that accompanied the DVD release, complete with identical cover artwork and opening pages, and given that this was one of most comprehensive Masters of Cinema booklets to date this has to be good news. A flick through both documents, however, reveals a few minor changes to the layout and, more crucially, the absence here of Turia, an Original Story Tabu (Taboo), A Story of the South Seas by F.W. Murnau and Robert J. Flaherty, a short essay on the film by Lotte Eisner, and a few film stills. What remains, however, is still substantial: , an updated and detailed 1990 essay on the film by Scott Eyman, including a map of the region in which the filming took place; , a 1959 Film Culture article by Richard Griffith; Flaherty's Hollywood Period: The Crosby Version , a revealing interview with cameraman Floyd Crosby from 1976; , a collection of extracts from telegrams and letters sent by and to Murnau during the shoot, including reproductions of actual documents; The Fire Spirit of Bora Bora: A Ghostly Experience from Murnau's South Pacific Diary , a newly translated article written by Murnau and originally published in 1940. If you don't already own the previous Masters of Cinema DVD then this is a no-brainer, but even if you do have it then I'd seriously consider upgrading, for the improvements in picture quality, for the correctly framed picture and for the additional extra features. Even more so than the DVD, this comes highly recommended, but hang on to the DVD for those extra articles in the booklet. Tabu: A Story of the South Seas F.W. Murnau F.W. Murnau R. J.

Specs & Instructions Study: Remote Controls Hotbed For Cold Germs CBS News Interactive: Healthwatch WASHINGTON (AP) - Someone in your house have the sniffles? Watch out for the refrigerator door handle. The TV remote, too. A new study finds that cold sufferers often leave their germs there, where they can live for two days or longer. Scientists at the University of Virginia, long known for its virology research, tested surfaces in the homes of people with colds and reported the results Tuesday at the nation's premier conference on infectious diseases. Doctors don't know how often people catch colds from touching germy surfaces as opposed to, say, shaking a sick person's hand, said Dr. Birgit Winther, an ear, nose and throat specialist who helped conduct the study. Two years ago, she and other doctors showed that germs survived in hotel rooms a day after guests left, waiting to be picked up by the next person checking in. For the new study, researchers started with 30 adults showing early symptoms of colds. Sixteen tested positive for rhinovirus, which causes about half of all colds. They were asked to name 10 places in their homes they had touched in the preceding 18 hours, and researchers used DNA tests to hunt for rhinovirus. "We found that commonly touched areas like refrigerator doors and handles were positive about 40 percent of the time" for cold germs, Winther said. All three of the salt and pepper shakers they tested were contaminated. Other spots found to harbor the germ: 6 out of 18 doorknobs; 8 of 14 refrigerator handles; 3 of 13 light switches; 6 of 10 remote controls; 8 of 10 bathroom faucets; 4 of 7 phones, and 3 of 4 dishwasher handles. Next, the researchers deliberately contaminated surfaces with participants' mucus and then tested to see whether rhinovirus stuck to their fingers when they turned on lights, answered the phone or did other common tasks. More than half of the participants got the virus on their fingertips 48 hours after the mucus was smeared. The study was sponsored by Reckitt-Benckiser Inc., makers of Lysol, but no products were tested in the research. The study, designed by doctors with no ties to the company, was an effort to lay the groundwork for future research on germs and ways to get rid of them. In a separate study, the university's Drs. Diane Pappas and Owen Hendley went germ-hunting on toys in the offices of five pediatricians in Fairfax, Va., three times during last year's cold and flu season. Tests showed fragments of cold viruses on 20 percent of all toys tested - 20 percent of those in the "sick child" waiting room, 17 percent in the "well child" waiting room, and 30 percent in a sack of toys that kids are allowed to choose from after being good for a shot. "Mamas know this," Hendley said. "They say, `We go to a doctor for a well-child checkup, the kids play with the toys and two days later they have a cold."' There is no proof that the remnants themselves can infect, but their presence suggests a risk, said Dr. Paul Auwaerter, an infectious-diseases specialist at Johns Hopkins University. He was familiar with the study but had no role in it. Doctors have long advised frequent hand-washing to avoid spreading germs. Wearing surgical masks and using hand sanitizers also can help, a novel University of Michigan study found. About 1,000 students who live in dorms tested these measures for six weeks during the 2006-07 flu season. They were divided into three groups: those who wore masks, those who wore masks and used hand sanitizer, and those who did neither. The two groups who used masks reported 10 percent to 50 percent fewer cold symptoms - cough, fever, chills - than the group who used no prevention measures. Researchers note that the study was not "blinded" - everyone knew who was doing what, and mask wearers may have been less likely to report cold symptoms later because they believed they were taking steps to reduce that possibility. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention paid for the study. The conference was a joint meeting of the American Society for Microbiology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

This graph is also available instead of acres.                           been far greater than in many other countries. The following                            States from 1996 to 2003. In 1999, the area planted                            U.S. soybean crop and about 25% of the U.S. corn crop.                            in 2000 increased 11% over the 1999 area ( James, 2000b ). Most of                            are either herbicide tolerant or insect pest-resistant.                            In addition to the crops listed below, minor acreages                            were planted to transgenic potato, squash, and papaya.                               area by country (source: James, 2000b ) (millions of acres) 74.8 soybean, corn, cotton, canola 24.7 soybean, corn, cotton 7.4 soybean, corn, canola 1.2 0.5 corn, cotton 0.4 soybean, potato For information on transgenic crop acreage as a percentage of the total U.S. acreage in 2000, see the news update entitled Acreage for transgenic cotton and soybeans up, corn down .

Many herbicides on the market control only certain types of weeds, and are approved for use only on certain crops at specific growth stages. Residues of some herbicides remain in the soil for a year or more, so that farmers must pay close attention to the herbicide history of a field when planning what to plant there. ® (chemical name: glyphosate) or ® (glufosinate). These herbicides are broad-spectrum, meaning that they kill nearly all kinds of plants those that have the tolerance gene. Thus, a farmer can apply a single herbicide to his fields of herbicide tolerant crops, and he can use Roundup and Liberty effectively at most crop growth stages as needed. Another important benefit is that this class of herbicides breaks down quickly in the soil, eliminating residue carry-over problems and reducing environmental impact. Herbicide tolerant varieties are popular with farmers because they enable less complicated, more flexible weed control. These varieties are commonly marketed as ® varieties.

Gianessi, AgBioForum online journal, Vol. 2 No. 2, http://www.agbioforum.org/ [ ] Bt Insect-Resistant Crops European corn borer (left) and                                  cotton bollworm (right) are two pests controlled                                  by Bt corn and cotton, respectively. Source: USDA. "Bt" is short for , a soil bacterium whose spores contain a crystalline (Cry) protein. In the insect gut, the protein breaks down to release a toxin, known as a delta-endotoxin. This toxin binds to and creates pores in the intestinal lining, resulting in ion imbalance, paralysis of the digestive system, and after a few days, insect death. Different versions of the Cry genes, also known as "Bt genes", have been identified. They are effective against different orders of insects, or affect the insect gut in slightly different ways. A few examples are shown in the table below. CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c) Cry1B, Cry1C, Cry1D Lepidoptera, Diptera Lepidoptera, Coleoptera The use of Bt to control insect pests is not new. Insecticides containing Bt and its toxins (e.g., Dipel, Thuricide, Vectobac) have been sold for many years. Bt-based insecticides are considered safe for mammals and birds, and safer for non-target insects than conventional products. What is new in Bt crops is that a modified version of the bacterial Cry gene has been incorporated into the plant's own DNA, so that the plant's cellular machinery produces the toxin. When the insect chomps on a leaf or bores into a stem of a Bt-containing plant, it ingests the toxin and will die within a few days. Bt insect-resistant crops currently on the market include Corn: primarily for control of European corn borer,                              but also corn earworm and Southwestern corn borer.                              the National Corn Growers Association web site ( http://www.ncga.com/biotechnology/know_where/know_grow_approved.htm ).

Source: USDA Corn rootworm ( spp.) is a serious                                  pest of corn in many U.S. growing areas. It damages                                  roots of young corn seedlings, resulting in reduced                                  growth and poor standability of the plant. This                                  largest amount of insecticide to U.S. corn fields.                                  What's more, to control this pest the insecticide                                  must be applied directly to the soil, where it                                  may leave residues or leach into the ground water.

More information about                            rootworm-resistant Bt hybrids is available in articles                            (2001) ,                           et al. (2001) , and                           (2001) .                           State University has a discussion of rootworm-protected  http://www.msue.msu.edu/ipm/CAT02_fld/FC4-11-02.htm#4 .                            Rootworm-resistant corn was approved in 2003. Have Bt crops reduced the use of chemical pesticides?                           amount of chemical pesticides applied to cotton. According                            to a story in Science ( Ferber,  ), US farmers used 450,000 kg less pesticides                            on Bt-cotton than they would have used on conventional                            varieties in 1998. Yields and profits also improved                            in Bt-cotton fields. The benefits from Bt-corn, however,                            were not as clear-cut. Due to the difficulty of effectively                            controlling corn borers with insecticides, most farmers                            corn fields. Thus, Bt hybrids substituted for chemical                            pesticides on only about 20% of the total US Bt-corn                            area. Profitability of Bt-corn is not as certain as                            for cotton; it will vary over years and locations, depending                            on the intensity of the corn borer population. See                           site. Will insect pests become resistant to Bt toxins?                           damage, as well as reducing fungal contamination of                            corn [                           and Heimlich, 1999 , http://www.apsnet.org/online/feature/BtCorn/Top.html ],                            target pests. This could mean the loss of Bt as an effective,                            environmentally friendly insecticide. In response to                            these concerns, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency                            development. These measures depend on a combination                            of high dose of the Bt toxin and a planting of refuges.                            A refuge refers to an area planted to a non-Bt variety                            variety, as shown in the diagram below. Diagram of the BT refuge strategy, in which at least 20% of a farm's corn acreage must be planted to non-BT corn. R = resistant European corn borer adult; S = susceptible adult. Beginning in 2000, the EPA requires that farmers growing Bt corn must plant at least 20% of their total corn acreage to a non-Bt variety. The rationale is that the few Bt-resistant insects surviving in the Bt field would likely mate with susceptible individuals that have matured in the non-Bt refuge. Thus, the insect genes (alleles) for resistance to Bt would be swamped by the susceptible alleles. Whether this strategy will work or not remains to be seen. Some of the potential problems with the refuge strategy are: The frequency of Bt-resistant alleles in insect populations may be greater than assumed in refuge models. Resistance to Bt in European corn borer may be semi-dominant rather than recessive. Resistant insects surviving in the Bt field may mature several days later than susceptible insects in the refuge, thus preventing their mating. For information on compliance with the refuge requirements,  29%                            of Bt corn farmers in U.S. broke the rules last year , 13%                            of Bt corn farmers in U.S. still breaking the rules,  , and 14%                            of U.S. Bt corn farmers still breaking the rules .                           of insect resistance to Bt. http://www.ag.uiuc.edu/cespubs/pest/articles/200203e.html .  http://www.pioneer.com/usa/agronomy/insects/yg_pug.pdf .

Zaar, Rogol Reviews - Justice League Europe - #13 Juuuuust a leetle too clever... - Some of the old Giffen/DeMatteis league stories are great -- triumphs of humor, drama (albeit "light" drama), characterization, pacing. And others are lame, lame like the jokes your unfunny 60-year-old uncle forwards to you. Maybe this issue had them guffawing at the DC offices, once upon a time... but by god, is it stupid by today's standards. That said, stupid is not the same thing as COMPLETELY unfunny. So I give it a "4". © 2005-2018 ComicBookDB.com - - - for the ComicBookDB.com logo design

RotoWire's Preseason Outlooks . Last season was a mixed bag of results for Frazier. On the good side of the ledger; he set career highs in home runs, walk rate, runs scored and RBI. On the bad side of the ledger; a career-worst batting average and strikeout rate. Those two normally go hand in hand, but throw in a career-high flyball rate and the poor guy never had much of a chance to hit for a good average. He pulled a lot of flyballs on his way to 40 home runs, with a high HR/FB ratio helping -- he only hit 21 doubles, making his 2015 total of 43 doubles look like an outlier. The steals from the third baseman help offset the damage from his batting average, and if he manages to make more consistent contact and hit near the league average, Frazier could return to among the fantasy elite. Frazier's trade to the White Sox in December cements the notion that the Reds are in for the long-term overhaul, rather than attempting a two-year fix. While last year's trade deadline was probably the time to get the most for him — Frazier hit just 10 homers after the break and had an OPS below .700 — they still might have sold at his peak. The good news for Frazier is that in Chicago he landed in a pretty good place to hit, though he's unlikely to fully replicate the home cooking he had in Cincinnati. Over the last three years, Frazier has 51 homers in Great American Ballpark and just 32 on the road. One of the shames of the 2014 season for the Reds is that they wasted the breakout seasons of Frazier and Devin Mesoraco. But was this season Frazier's peak, or one of a few more that we can expect in the future? Many of the underlying metrics suggest that this is his level -- his strikeout and walk rates have been remarkably stable the last three years, and his ISO was actually higher in 2012 when he first established himself as a regular player. The only stat that appears to be an outlier was his 20 stolen bases -- even in the minors he had never run that often. Assuming that Joey Votto is healthier this year, the Reds will finally leave Frazier at third base rather than move him all over the diamond, but you'll have the capability of slotting him at first if you'd like, which may be more of an advantage than in previous years, considering the state of the first base pool. Some regression was expected in Frazier's stat line in his second full season in the big leagues, but instead the pendulum fully swung from lucky to unlucky, as his BABIP dropped from .320 down to .271. But bad luck can't fully explain Frazier's drop-off, as he continued to have a poor contact rate (76%) and his ISO dropped from .225 down to .173. To contend in 2014, the Reds need more from their right-handed hitters, and Frazier in particular. He may never exceed his 2012 rate stats, but he needs to approach them to be viable beyond this season. Frazier rode the extended playing time provided by injuries to Scott Rolen and Joey Votto to a second place finish in the NL Rookie of the Year voting, though a September fade (.181/.241/.264 in 72 at-bats) might have cost him the award. With Rolen likely to retire, Frazier is finally slated to have one position all to himself at third base. With a .320 BABIP and 76 percent contact rate last year, Frazier's .273 batting average is a likely candidate to decline in 2013, but that change could be counter-balanced, at least in terms of his fantasy value, by the increased playing time and the rise in counting stats that comes along with that. Frazier will be 27 in 2013, so this is pretty close to as good as it gets for him. While repeating Triple-A in 2011, Frazier made enough gains to at least give some hope that he could be a major league bench player, if not a regular. As with teammate Juan Francisco, Frazier has some power potential with a less-than-optimal batting eye. He's never going to be a plus defender, though it appears as if he might be able to hold his own at third base. What might end up happening is that he'll platoon with Francisco at third base while occasionally filling in elsewhere. That scenario might not kick in until the second half of 2012 if not the start of 2013, with Scott Rolen under contract for another season. Frazier took a step back last year at Triple-A Louisville, nearly doubling his strikeout rate while dropping in batting average by 40-plus points. He regressed enough to the point that the Reds didn't make him one of their September callups, instead choosing to keep him off the 40-man roster. Frazier's other problem is that he's without a position, having washed out at shortstop and second already. He split time between left field, third base and first base with Louisville last season, and probably projects best as an outfielder, where his value is limited. A return engagement in Louisville seems in the cards for Frazier. Though Frazier is considered by many to be the Reds' top prospect, his long-term value is muted by a lack of positional value. Once drafted as a shortstop, Frazier has played third, left field and some second base. They worked with him on the latter position this offseason, only to state that he'll open 2010 as Triple-A Louisville's left fielder. As a middle infielder, he would be a plus-bat, but as a corner outfielder he's only average. A first-round supplemental pick in 2007, Frazier has hit at every professional level, including the Hawaii Winter League (.295/.375/.547) in 2008. The bigger issue for Frazier is what position he'll end up playing - most scouts and analysts suggest that he won't be able to stick at shortstop - third base or a corner outfield spot is more likely.

Utah Workers' Compensation Study Florida Workers' Compensation Study California Workers' Compensation Study Oregon Workers' Compensation Study Australian Workers' Compensation Study The Utah Study - fewer costs and days lost This 1988 Utah workers' compensation board study found a tenfold savings for mean   compensation costs in back-related injuries treated by chiropractors as compared with medical doctors ($68.38 vs. $668.39). To ensure accurate and true results, only those back-related injuries   with the same diagnostic codes were compared between the two treatment groups. Also, the medical treatments assessed were limited to nonsurgical medical treatments only.

Journal of   Occupational Medicine - 1991;33:847-52. The Florida Study - shorter disability, lower costs, and lower hospitalization rates This large study - conducted by the State of Florida - examined 10,652 patients who   sustained back-related injuries on the job. Their findings revealed individuals who received chiropractic care compared with standard medical care experienced had a (i) 51.3 percent shorter   temporary total disability duration (ii) lower treatment cost by 58.8 percent (iii) 20.3 percent hospitalization rate in the chiropractic care group vs. 52.2 percent rate in the medical care group.

Those who received chiropractic treatments returned to work in an average of 15.6 days vs. 32 days in those who received treatments from   medical doctors. Industrial Back Injury. Wolf CR. International Review of Chiropractic - 1974;26:6-7. The Oregon Study - chiropractic gets individuals back to work, and fast!

In fact, under chiropractic care 82% were able to return to work after one week compared with only 41% in those who received   medical care. A Study of Time Loss Back Claims. Portland, OR. Workers' Compensation Board, State of Oregon, March 1971.

Covet Studio is a gallery concept that was derived over years of hunting and gathering.  Throughout my career as a designer, I've continually struggled in the quest to find just the right, unique pieces for my clients.  This searching took both time and energy...luxuries that most people do not have today.  Often on my expeditions, I would come across incredible pieces that were not right for the project at hand, but that I just could not pass up. Hiding these gems away in storage seemed to be a sin, so Covet Studio was born.  For me, the thrill of the hunt continues, so that I can offer pieces that will make your home the envy of your neighborhood. 1942 Raymond Dr. Northbrook, Illinois 60062 | 847.205.1983 p | 847.220.1983 c

Generally, people look for an alternate and conventional approach to take care of herniated discs. Chiropractic treatment is a different treatment choice for disc herniation. This is chosen by numerous clients that are pleased with this method to neck and back pain therapy. Currently, chiropractic therapy is the third biggest healthcare career all over the world and also had actually been instituted as a structure in the back treatment industry. People usually ask, “Just what is herniated disc?” It is a basic term for intervertebral spine disc which has actually either fractured or protruded. Consequently, its normal form and also position in the spine gets changed. On the other hand, those which remain intact are called disc protrusions or slid discs, bulging discs, and prolapsed discs. Ruptured discs are those which tear open. Sequestered or extruded discs are those that obtain materials of the core spilled right into the body cavity. Due to this categorization, several clients usually neglect or do not understand the fundamentals of the disorder and their particular herniation trouble. Chiropractic doctors theorize that the spinal imbalances affect the function of the nerve system. They consider the spine as a neurological highway that guides sensory, motor, as well as autonomic functions of the body. An ideal spine positioning is required to achieve a maximum general health and wellness problem. The bones which comprise the back as well as are movable are known as vertebrae. It becomes subluxated when it heads out of its regular location. These vertebral subluxations are the ones thought to be causing conditions and need chiropractic care therapy. Chiropractic treatment doctors will certainly make use of hands-on adjustment strategies to check out the spinal column as well as neck to check for subluxations. After recognizing misalignments, will utilize core control techniques to remedy them. Treatment for disc herniation depends on a great deal of elements such as perseverance and also degree of symptoms and also age. Therapy can range from easy administrations such as physical treatment or anti-inflammatory regimen to even more intrusive ones such as cortisone shots or surgery. Given that surgical treatment is a radical option plus it is not always successful in fixing the issue, it would certainly be best to choose an extra natural approach. Often times, a disc condition can get better with time. Consequently, conventional means such as chiropractic treatment is usually advised before undertaking intrusive procedures and also surgical procedure. Normally, people are alarmed when they discover that they have actually herniated disc and are afraid that its supreme therapy is only surgery. For the most parts, the conventional technique of chiropractic treatment is helpful and also people react more than time. Medical studies offer information that only 10% of herniated disc clients that had chiropractic treatment yet still had noticeable signs went through procedure. Connect with a Chiropractor such as professionals from Chiropractic Colorado Springs or any other experienced healthcare expert to confer regarding your case and also exactly what they can do concerning it. Chiropractic specialists are professionals in analyzing subluxations and lessen, or even better, fix them. Usually, a collection of sessions is usually scheduled to take care of the vertebral subluxations in the back. They will use core control strategies to decompress the vertebrae, allowing the disc to regenerate in time. Chiropractic practitioners, such as those from Chiropractic Colorado Springs, will make use of chiropractic care strategies, fitness counseling, wellness workouts, and also various other required treatment procedures to help with in alleviating muscular tissue hypertonicity and also pain relevant with intervertebral disc disorders. These consist of suggestions on lifestyle adjustment, nutrition counseling, and also teaching lumbar stabilizing and also body enhancing workouts to assist the muscles on the back. Chiropractors treatment do spine modifications to deal with the subluxations but do not heal the symptoms connected with disc herniation. The imbalanced pressure on the discs is removed after the vertebral subluxations are treated. After the stress is eliminated, the discs regenerate. The impacts of this correction last long.

Miss Mary Workman, Los Angeles, Calif. Dear Miss Workman:  I wish to begin this letter by wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It is not my custom to make complaints, but Saturday I found the shop at Brownson House in pretty bad order.  Since the Boy Scouts have been meeting there the tools have been misplaced and the shop has been in general disorder.  This was not so bad, for the tools could be replaced and the shop put in order.  However, last Saturday the paints were thrown about the room, on the grindstone, etc. and the turpentine bottle emptied.  Many valuable Pieces of veneer had been waster.  In fact it looked as if the boys had been turned loose in the shop and had engaged in the pitched battle. In making this complaint to you, I take it that the standards of Brownson House should be above that sort of thing and I am sure that the are; also, that you people expect me to do my part in upholding these high standards.  Had not material been wasted as it was, I would not have said a word about it.  Knowing that you desire me to be as economical as possible, I thought it only right that you know the facts.  I do not care to make any fight on the Scout Master, but evident he is not used to handling boys. I hope you will pardon me for bothering you about this matter, but I did  not know where a complaint should be made--hence this letter. In looking over the grounds at Brownson House I find that by removing one rope swing and the teeter totter, a building 22 feet by about 48 feet can be erected.  Then, by removing the old wash house, another extension could be erected.  By making these additions two stories high, considerable room could be had.  This would give Brownson House a Sloyd Shop well worthy of the name. If I can be of further assistance to you in this or other matter pertaining to the Brownson House, kindly let me know it. I am Sincerely yours, [signed] John W. Lang you wish to report: Your comment: Your Name: ... William H. Hannon Library | | | America's West Catholicism in L.A.

a "PPM" and a "VU" combined,                             each parameter. The result is an established relationship                             between the PEAK and the RMS content. When riding                             gain for balanced loudness, PEAKS should be driven                             to the brink of the top set of three red LEDs, while                         driven to the brink of the center set of 3 red LEDs,                         or whichever event happens first in time. This is defined                         as RELATIVE LOUDNESS, in one dB steps from source to                         source. More simply put, whenever an operator sees red,                         he or she should pull levels back slightly!

News, Views and Analysis July 13, 2008 11:57 AM | First the video ( h/t , and a further h/t for stimulating this post): My initial reaction was the same as that of my friend Red Tory. At the very margins of political correctness. Beyond silly. A black hole is so named because its gravity is so intense that no light can escape from it. You can't go around calling it a "white hole" or a "pink hole." But the man in the video actually raises an interesting point. With the exception of "in the black," popular usages of the word tend to connote something negative. " Black arts," "black hearts,"  "black look," "black book," "blackout," "black sheep," "blackguard," etc., etc. No wonder the Irish refer in their language to " " rather than "black people." ("An fear dubh" means "the Devil," literally, "the black man." Hence, out of respect, "an fear gorm" is used for Blacks.) It's no coincidence that colonialists called Kipling's "lesser breeds without the Law" "black." It accorded with the connotations the word already had. Ditto "white." When did we start calling ourselves "white," anyway? Quite during the Age of Discovery, as it happens (scroll down to n.35 in the link). Why is someone half-white and half-black "black? instead of "white?" Because the notion of blackness has been made equivalent to sin: maculate vs. immaculate, the staining of purity. "Whiteness," of course, is an ever-shifting category . The connotations of both "white" and "black" are far too deeply embedded, in any case, to be overcome simply by watching one's words. But there is a solution. I've never seen a person, just people in various delightful hues ranging from ebony (actually a very dark brown) to light tan. Instead of internalizing centuries of white racism, perhaps Blacks (who adopted that nomenclature in the 'sixties as a form of political defiance, much as the word "queer" was reclaimed by gays) might want to consider referring to themselves as brown, or umber, or bronze. And we non-Blacks should follow suit, of course. Speaking as a pinkish kind of person, it seems to me that this would be a far less arduous cultural hill to climb.

Local Music Stores: Pineville, Louisiana (2 Entries) Pineville, LA (318) 641-1444 Pineville, LA (318) 441-2227 1inc/oxo.html According to a small National Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) survey (1), an estimated 10% of Americans have tried acupuncture, and of those who haven't, two-thirds would consider it. If true, this would mean about 30 million Americans have tried acupuncture, which is amazing, considering it's only been in the U.S. for 30 years, and there are only about 15,000 acupuncturists, many of whom have only been licensed in the last 10 years. However, data from a 2004 U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services report (2) analyzed responses from a much larger group of Americans (31,044) from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey, and found that only 4% had ever tried acupuncture. Still, the same data shows that acupuncture is slightly more popular than homeopathy, four times more popular than naturopathy, and ten times more popular than ayurveda. Succeeding the now outdated 1997 National Institute of Health's Consensus Statement on Acupuncture is the World Health Organization's 2002 Review of Randomized Controlled Acupuncture Trials. They grouped their results this way: 9 diseases Western medicine can't treat well (proof is weak but acupuncture is worth trying), and 7 diseases in which acupuncture could be tried if the practitioner has sufficient medical knowledge and equipment. Of course, this is only one kind of research, which answers the question, "Does acupuncture definitely help people with such and such disease?" Answering such questions is complicated by the fact that there is more than one style of acupuncture, and so even if one style doesn't help, if the others haven't been tried, we can't conclude that ALL acupuncture won't help the condition in question. Plus, there are other types of research that look more specifically at what parts of the body are affected by different acupuncture points. For example, MRI's and PET-scans have shown specific areas of the brain (e.g., the visual cortex, or Broca's area on the left side) activated by specific points. Since different people with the same disease have different issues, breaking the research down into these component parts may provide more valuable information for clinical acupuncture than simply finding out that one or another combination of points helped a certain percentage of people with a specific disease.313 If you've been interested in starting your own internet business but you've been trying to avoid the hassles of things like developing and producing products, tracking your inventory, setting up warehouse space, and maintaining a confusing shipping/receiving infrastructure, then drop shipping may be your answer. It allows you to sell quality, brand-name products on your website for a hefty profit, while someone else looks after product development and order fulfillment. Although the process can be a boon to internet entrepreneurs, you should know the advantages and disadvantages to this business model before getting started. In addition to not having to worry about shipping products yourself, there are a few other advantages to this business model. First, it saves you the cost of building your own inventory. If you're like most people starting a small business, you don't have a ton of extra money lying around, so the last thing you want to do is tie up your cash in inventory that you may or may not be able to sell. Second, no inventory also means no leftovers. If the product you sell suddenly becomes outdated, obsolete or just plain untrendy, you aren't the one with a room or warehouse full of stock nobody will buy. Many online retailers find themselves having to offer deep discounts--and taking huge losses--on old products just to get them out of their homes or warehouses to make room for more inventory. Third, you'll be able to add new products to your site almost instantly. Since you don't have to worry about stocking inventory, if you find your customers clamoring for a particular product, it's not unrealistic to expect you could add the item to your site in just a few days. Have you noticed there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of sites selling huge mish-mash selections of inexpensive gift items . . . things like plastic gnomes and porcelain figurines? That's because there are a few very large drop shipping companies that import these items and then recruit websites to sell them on their behalf. Unfortunately, this is not the way for you to go if you're getting started with drop shipping. There are already a lot of giant gift sites out there--and way too much competition for you to reasonably expect to be successful at it. Music Info: ` Health Info: Top Pics: Arena rock is a loosely defined style of rock music. Arena rock is usually medium hard rock, but lacks the edginess or rage often inherent in heavy metal. Simple rhythms, acoustic/electric guitar interplay, and keyboards define the instrumental sound, and vocally the music is far closer to mainstream pop than most hard rock or metal.

NEWSLETTER SIGN-UP Sign-up for our monthly health newsletter! First Name: Last Name: Email: The experts know that chest training must be planned Failure to structure your chest routine towards overall pec development, as well as failure to work on weak points in your pecs can lead to   noticeable imbalances. Exercises: Exercise 1 - Incline Bench Press Exercise 2 - Decline Bench Press Exercise 3 - Flat Dumbbell Flys In the previous two issues, we discussed maximizing the development of the arms and   midsection. It seems right that next on our priority list of "showable" summer body parts would be the chest. There should be method in training those pectoralis muscles. The overall shape and   development of the chest is a product of the exercises you choose and how those exercises are incorporated into your overall chest workout. Ignoring certain exercises or concentrating solely on one   type of chest exercise can lead you to pec imbalances. The most common type of "imbalance" with the chest is deficient upper pec development. This is common in those individuals who fail to   incorporate incline bench presses into their training or save them until the end of their chest workout, when the clock has struck twelve and their chest has turned into a pumpkin. The pectoralis muscle originates on the sternum, upper 6 rib cartilages, and medial   aspect of the clavicle, and inserts on the lateral lip of the greater tubercle of the humerus. Great, what good is that you ask. Well, knowing where the muscle originates and inserts helps you to   better understand the movements the pectoralis muscle is responsible for. For practical reasons, you should know that the pectoralis adducts (brings towards mid-line) the upper arm and elbow (think   of performing pec deck or fly exercises), forward flexes the upper arm (as in the bench press movements), as well as assists with internal rotation of the upper arm (as in cable crossovers). There are 3 distinct regions within the muscle that will develop depending upon the exercises you perform. It is important that you train the upper, middle and lower regions of the pectoralis   muscle, as well as begin with the exercise which focuses on the weakest area of your chest. For most people that's the upper chest. And for this reason, we begin our workout with the incline   movement. As you've probably guessed, our workout will consist of 3 exercises in which each   focuses on a different region of the chest. We begin with incline bench press, then go to decline bench press, and end our training with flat bench flys. Begin the workout with 5 minutes of   stretching using 5-10 pound weights in each hand. With weights in hand, lie on a flat bench and allow your fully extended arms to dip down to the floor. This stretches out the pecs and prepares   your chest for the workout ahead. Then, for each exercise perform 1-2 light warm-up sets of 15 repetitions using a light weight which allows you to effectively warm up the muscles for that   particular movement without causing premature fatigue. After the warm-up, perform 4 sets of the exercise with the following repetitions: 12, 10, 8, 6. Gradually increase the weight with each set.   The weight you choose should allow you to complete the desired number of repetitions for each set, but the weight should also be sufficient so that the final few reps demand the most out of your   pecs. Having a spotter for safety as well as assisting in a forced rep or two is a definite advantage. Exercise 1 - Incline Bench Press This exercise will help you develop the weakest area of your chest, at least with most of us... the upper chest. Beginning your workout with this exercise will allow you to use maximum power from   your upper chest to force that chest to grow! Keep the movement slow and controlled while getting full movement, bringing the bar or dumbbells all the way down, then all the way to the top. While   you press the weight up your primary focus should be on squeezing your chest. Exercise 2 - Decline Bench Press This exercise is excellent for developing the lower aspect of your chest. This exercise has a tendency to really work those triceps too so remember to focus on squeezing the chest. Avoiding   complete lockout of your elbows will also decrease your triceps involvement. Exercise 3 - Flat Dumbbell Flys This is an excellent exercise to finish off your chest workout. It is an isolation movement which places complete focus on the pectoralis muscles. This is because it consists of pure arm adduction   which is the primary movement performed by the pectoralis muscles. Start by lying on a flat bench with your arms fully extended above your chest with your palms facing each other and elbows   slightly bent. Bring the weights down towards the floor while maintaining the slight elbow flexion. Stop when you feel your arms are close to locking out. Then squeeze your pecs as you bring the   weights back to the starting position. The entire movement should be 100% focused on squeezing the pecs together... as if you had an egg between your pecs and you were attempting to crack the shell   as you squeezed those pecs together. You won't be able to help but notice that the incline and decline presses also   effectively work the middle chest. Thus, performing these two exercises and finishing with the flat flys not only blasts your upper and lower chest, it also provides the mid pec region with an   incredible workout. You should also note that I have not specified barbell or dumbbell for the incline or decline presses. This is because you should change between barbells and dumbbells every 1-2   months, or whenever you feel your gains have slowed down or halted. This is the most effective means of getting continual gains out of your chest, or any other body part. If you have a workout   partner some of the time, it would be wise to save the barbell training for the times your partner can spot you. This way you won't get caught alone in pectoralis failure while the barbell is still   on your chest. Safety first! Remember these important points to maximize your pectoralis gains: Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze the chest and nothing else. On every repetition of your chest routine you must focus on squeezing the chest... do this and the weight will go in the appropriate     direction. Be sure to perform a full motion but don't over do it. Getting a good stretch with each exercise is important... however, when you're handling heavier weights don't completely lock out     your joints in the down position as this places a great deal of stress on ligaments, joint capsules and other supporting structures. Push-ups are good if you can't make it to the gym or if you're out of town and can't get to a gym. They work the pecs but they are definitely no replacement for the real thing. They simply     do not provide the quality and quantity of resistance that free weights give. Never attempt to "max out" or try a new heavier weight without a spotter. Remember this cardinal rule especially when using barbells to prevent a potentially serious injury.

Most of these platforms had a 25-year design life, with many of them having already outlived this milestone and many more approaching it. Additionally, modifications on many of the platforms have been made due to updated design criteria or because of revamping projects executed for enhanced oil recovery. As a result, the requalification of these structures was highly important to ensure continued oil production, thus sustaining the energy supply needed for the national growth. ONGC also wanted to avoid installing new platforms at a net cost of USD 25 million per platform. ONGC invested USD 150 million to assess its jacketed platforms for extended “fit for use” and strengthen the platforms as required to meet industry safety requirements. ONGC used SACS for design-level analysis to carry out detailed structural analyses and SACS Collapse for ultimate strength analysis. This technology became part of ONGC’s methodology for platform life extension/requalification, which added 10-15 years to the average life of each structure. The analysis included dent modeling, member/joint component strengthening, additional pile modeling, and soil convergence, as well as extensive load modeling to recommend equipment removal if necessary. SACS and SACS Collapse, with the efficient multi-run option, allowed multiple analyses with parametric variations to be carried out simultaneously and enabled ONGC to optimize the strengthening/mitigation measures, saving at least 12 resource-hours per platform. Dinesh Kumar-GGM, head structures, IEOT-ONGC, India, said, “The wide range of applications offered under the umbrella of Bentley technology has resulted in ONGC being able to manage our offshore assets much more efficiently.” Posted by : Dubai PR Network Editorial Team PR Category : : Wednesday, January 25, 2017  4:17:00 PM UAE local time (GMT+4) Replication or redistribution in whole or in part is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of DubaiPRNetwork.com.

Here's what our clients say. "We just wanted to say thank you for a terrific job at listing and marketing our home...It was great working with a professional team like yours." Ken & Cara Garratt "I just wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for your amazing efforts to help us sell our home in Inverness. I realize you inherited a house that had already been on the market for a year with no success and that in itself was a challenge. Your marketing was clearly a major factor in selling our home as you reached out repeatedly to surrounding communities. I have sold many homes in my lifetime and never had the cooperation and support from a Realtor that I received from you." "Thank you so much for not only helping us find our dream home, but also in assisting us with the sale of our existing home. We could not have done this in such a short turnaround without your guidance and expertise. You are the best!" "Scott and I would like to thank you again for sticking it out with us. Although all of us anticipated a quick sale, we still ended up with the same result. We could not have asked for a more dedicated Realtor. Thank you!" Scott & Mary Mottonen "We want to thank you for making our dream a reality. We know that with God all things are possible...but your group were an integral part of the process...thank you for helping us hurdle the obstacles and unselfishly putting our interest above your own profit." Chris & Wendy Canedy "If you are looking for the best Realtor in Inverness, look no further than Chris Jacobs. His unparalleled market knowledge and extensive experience are backed by a highly professional and dedicated team...Most of all, Chris is unwavering in placing the best interest of his clients above all else, providing sound advise and knowledgeable guidance" Tom & Linda D'Amico "Thank you so much for everything you did to sell our house. Laura & I couldn't thank you enough. You made a very stressful process very easy." Andy & Laura Tieman "It was a pleasure to work with the Team. They truly supported us and had wonderful marketing tools...All of these helped sell our home in a relatively short time frame given the 2007 downturn of housing sales." "My wife and I had Heidi Doering help us buy our new house and sell our old house. She is an excellent Realtor...Heidi is always a consummate professional. She had excellent ideas for selling our old house and showed an exorbitant amount of patience when we were buying our new house...I would recommend Heidi to anyone who wants to buy or sell a house and have a great experience. In fact, my family and clients have used Heidi's services and they have all been impressed. My wife and I always refer to her as our favorite Realtor and we certainly mean it." "Thank you so much for all your work with getting the Burton house sold. Your kindness & diligence is greatly appreciated." "Everything Sharon did was special to me. Her concern, positive attitude, business knowledge, and availability." "Thank you so much for your great service!!! We appreciate all the work you did for us" Elmer & Lihuey Silva "Her responsiveness and attention always exceeded our expectations. Her knowledge and experience in the industry helped keep the process flowing smoothly and kept our minds at ease. We would highly recommend her to friends and family" "I just wanted to let you know how pleased my husband and I were with Kathy Jacobs. She made what could have been a very stressful experience a pleasant one. I felt like I had a friend coming with me house hunting instead of a Realtor. It was her personal attention, her informative way of explaining things and guidance that put us both at ease." Jamie-Danielle Hills "I remember you telling me as we were discussing the price offered on the house that if we took it, in a month or so we would be so glad we did - well....... you were certainly right! thanks again for the good counsel and advise on selling the house... A world of thanks! You really went above & beyond & we really appreciate it greatly." Jim & Jo Rasmus "When I first met Her, she was very professional and took me to showings when ever I asked. She was always there when I wanted to see a home! I have sold 2 homes with her and have purchased 2 new homes. We are now the closest of friends." "We appreciated all your hard work. Thank you so much!" Dilip & Harsha Thakkar "We wouldn't have come to this day without your help. From the first time we met you, to negotiating the final price of our house, your professional approach gave us confidence and comfort." Paul & Lynn Tieman "Thanks for exceeding our expectations!"

U.S. MSNBC.com NBC.com Re/Code From left, Sen. Rob Portman, Rep. Paul Ryan & Former Minn. Gov. Tim Pawlenty Romney’s three VP finalists: Pawlenty (the loyal outsider), Portman (the insider), and Ryan (the crusader)… GOPers are currently split over whether Romney should pick Ryan… New Q-polls: Romney leads in CO -- where Obama stumps today -- but trails in VA and WI… The Romney camp’s danger in elevating Bill Clinton: You turn him into a fair observer just before his primetime convention speech… New Romney and Priorities USA TV ads play loose with the facts… Romney Hood vs. Obamaloney… McCaskill gets her man… And conservatives in MO and KS wage (and win) the “Border War.” By NBC's Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, and Domenico Montanaro Scott Olson / Getty Images Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney speaks to workers during a campaign event at Acme Industries on August 7, 2012 in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. *** : We can say with a high degree of confidence that Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential pick has largely come down to three men: former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan. And it’s more than possible that Romney has already made up his mind. All three VP finalists bring something different to the table. Pawlenty is the loyal outsider, who would enable a Romney-Pawlenty ticket to run as former governors vowing to take on Washington; Pawlenty also potentially would add some blue-collar appeal to the ticket. Portman would be the insider, someone who knows the ways of Washington and who could help govern starting on Day 1. And Ryan would be the crusader, who wants to substantially transform America’s entitlement programs and who would excite a good portion of the GOP’s conservative base. Indeed, Ryan has emerged a VERY REAL possibility, but he also brings the most risk. If Romney selects him, it’s more than conceivable that the dominant campaign discussion in the fall won’t be the economy -- but rather the deficit and Medicare. Of course, there was already a good chance the Ryan plan will get plenty attention regardless of Romney’s VP pick. *** Bold vs. cautious GOPers divided on Ryan : writes that Republican observers are split on Ryan. “Ryan advocates, including some of his colleagues and high-profile conservative elites, believe Romney will lose if he doesn’t make a more assertive case for his candidacy and that selecting the 42-year-old wonky golden boy would sound a clarion call to the electorate about the sort of reforms the presumptive GOP nominee wants to bring to Washington. Call them the ‘go bold’ crowd.” On the other hand: “Their opposites, pragmatic-minded Republican strategists and elected officials, believe that to select Ryan is to hand President Barack Obama’s campaign a twin-edged blade, letting the incumbent slash Romney on the Wisconsin congressman’s Medicare proposal and carve in the challenger a scarlet ‘C’ for the unpopular Congress. This is the cautious corner.” NBC's Mark Murray and Domenico Montanaro narrow down Mitt Romney's vice presidential candidate picks to three and discuss newly released Â poll numbers. *** Polling the over-50 crowd : Just how important could the debate over the Ryan budget, especially if he’s Romney’s VP pick? Just consider this of voters over 50, in which Obama and Romney are tied 45-45% with the group (and with Obama’s approval at just 42%). Per this poll, 91% believe “Social Security is critical to the economic security of seniors” and “the next president and Congress need to strengthen Social Security so that it is able to provide retirement security for future generations.” (That includes about three-quarters of Romney voters.) And on Medicare: 95% say “Medicare is critical to maintaining the health of seniors” and 88% say the next president and Congress “need to strengthen Medicare so that it is able to provide health coverage in retirement for future generations.” The poll was conducted by Hart Research and GS Strategy Group. (Disclosure: Hart Research is the Democratic half of the NBC-WSJ poll.) *** Romney leads in CO, but Obama’s ahead in VA and WI : Last week, President Obama campaigned in Florida and Ohio -- just as new Quinnipiac/New York Times/CBS polls showed him leading (and above 50%) in those two states. But today, as he begins a two-day swing through Colorado, shows him trailing Romney among likely by five points in the state, 50%-45%. That said, new Quinnipiac/New York Times/CBS surveys also show Obama leading in Virginia (49%-45%) and Wisconsin (51%-45%). So out of the six battleground states that Quinnipiac has polled in the past two weeks -- Colorado, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin -- Obama leads in five of them. And speaking of polls, a new national Washington Post/ABC survey finds that Romney’s fav/unfav is still underwater at 40%-49% versus Obama’s 53%-43%. In fact, adds that Romney “is laboring under the lowest personal popularity ratings for a presumptive presidential nominee in midsummer election-year polls back to 1984.” *** : Over the past few months, the Romney campaign has elevated Bill Clinton (and even Hillary) in an attempt to divide Democrats and to appeal to downscale white voters. And now comes the Romney camp’s . “In 1996, President Clinton and a bipartisan Congress helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare,” the narrator says in it. “But on July 12th, President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements.” As writes, this effort is to portray Clinton as the “good” kind of Democrat and Obama as the “bad” kind. But there is a real danger here for the Romney campaign and Republicans: Clinton is supporting Obama, and he can swing back like he did last night when he released a statement calling the ad “not true.” More Clinton: The recently announced waiver policy was originally requested by the Republican governors of Utah and Nevada to achieve more flexibility in designing programs more likely to work in this challenging environment. The administration has taken important steps to ensure that the work requirement is retained and that waivers will be granted only if a state can demonstrate that more people will be moved into work under its new approach.” *** You turn him into a fair observer, just when he has a primetime speaking slot : What’s more, Clinton will be delivering a big primetime speech at the Democratic convention. So when the Romney campaign airs this kind of TV ad -- elevating Clinton as a fair observer in this presidential contest -- persuadable voters might be paying attention to what Clinton has to say at the Dem convention. And what happens if Bubba unloads on Romney? Just something to consider… *** : Speaking of that new Romney TV ad on welfare, has already pointed out that it’s a dubious assertion to claim that Obama is trying to “gut welfare reform.” Why? Because the HHS memo in question clearly states that it “will only consider approving waivers relating to the work participation requirements that make changes intended to lead to more effective means of meeting the work goals of TANF." In other words, the work requirement is still there. So when Romney told FOX last night that Obama believes that “they shouldn’t have to have the work requirement” isn’t a correct statement. But there is a clear reason why the Romney camp wants to continue airing this TV ad: Obama continues to overperform with downscale whites, especially in places like Ohio. But this Romney advertisement isn’t the only new TV ad out there that’s playing loose with the facts. The pro-Obama Super PAC Priorities USA Action with a man claiming that he lost his family’s health insurance after Bain Capital helped close a Kansas City steel plant in 2001 -- and that his wife died shortly after. But as notes, the man’s wife died in 2006, years after the steel plant closed down. *** “Romney Hood” vs. “Obamaloney” : But not only are the TV ads playing loose with the facts, the rhetoric on the campaign trail also has devolved to name calling. So on Monday night, there was Obama talking about “Romney Hood,” seizing on that recent non-partisan Tax Policy Center report. "[Romney would] ask the middle class to pay more taxes so that he could give another $250,000 tax cut to people making more than $3 million a year. It's like Robin Hood in Reverse. It's Romney Hood!" And here’s how Romney countered to FOX: “We’ve been watching the president say a lot of things about me and about my policies. And they’re just not right. And if I were to coin a term, it would be ‘Obamaloney.’” Have we really gotten to the name calling stage of the campaign in August?  Ugly. Are the candidates proud of the tone of the campaign? *** : Obama stumps in Colorado, hitting Denver at 3:20 pm ET and Grand Junction at 7:25 pm ET… Romney campaigns in Des Moines, IA at 9:25 am ET… Meanwhile, Romney’s surrogates and VP possibilities are out in full force -- Portman attends campaign office openings in Colorado; Pawlenty visits Michigan; and Chris Christie raises money for Romney in California. *** : Endangered Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) caught a real break last night when the one challenger she was HOPING to run against -- Rep. Todd Akin (R) -- surprisingly won his competitive three-way GOP Senate primary in Missouri last night. As writes, “Polls have showed McCaskill trailing Akin though she polls closer to him than she did against businessman John Brunner and former Treasurer Sarah Steelman, who Akin edged Tuesday.” This Missouri Senate contest is a real race now. McCaskill still may lose, but it’s going to be close. Meanwhile, while Democrats were bracing that Jay Inslee (D) would come in second to Rob McKenna (R) in Washington state’s blanket gubernatorial primary, it turns out that Inslee got 47% to McKenna’s 43%, per the . Now, as Democrats had been telling First Read, the blanket primary isn’t the best way to judge what will happen in November, because the electorates are different. But still, Democrats have to feel good about last night’s result in Washington. *** Conservatives wage and win ‘Border War’: The Kansas-Missouri rivalry -- in sports as well as what happened in the 1800s -- is known as the “Border War” and last night conservatives won their own version in both states . In Missouri, after his victory last night, Akin : “This campaign is about reclaiming our Godly values, rebuilding the American Dream, restoring the America that we love.” Across the border, in Kansas, nine incumbent, moderate-leaning GOP state senators, including the Senate president, were ousted -- and it was fueled by outside money, including from the Koch Brothers. Their sin: Working with Democrats “to block some of the most aggressive parts of [Gov. Sam] Brownback’s agenda.” : “The Kansas GOP’s not getting over this any time soon. Normally, after a primary, the party throws a unity breakfast. Not this morning.” Countdown to GOP convention: 19 days Countdown to Dem convention: 26 days presidential debate: 56 days Countdown to VP debate: 64 days presidential debate: 69 days presidential debate: 75 days Countdown to Election Day: 90 days Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

The 2016 Olympic Games conclude on 21st of August. The games were quite a spectacle, and now the next Games has been awarded to Tokyo, Japan in the year 2020. Tokyo last hosted the games in 1998; this will be their second chance at hosting the global event. A host of new games will appear on the list of disciplines for athletes to compete. The International Olympics Committee, IOC, has approved the following five games for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Baseball/Softball, Karate, Skateboard, Sports Climbing, Surfing The decision to add these disciplines was a culmination of a two-year lobbying process, where organizing committees of the host country have the flexibility to propose new sports discipline for consideration. The IOC intends to allow and encourage innovation and flexibility with a focus on youth in the development of the Olympic program. In September, 2015, the proposal for the addition of the games was submitted by the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee. Various factors were considered by the IOC which includes the impact on gender equality, the legacy value of adding the disciplines to the games, and the youth appeal to the sports. The addition of the games will add a total of 18 events and 474 athletes. Skateboarding and sports climbing will be held in temporary venues installed in various urban settings. The inclusion of the games will bring the Games to young people and usher in the trend of urbanization sport. The additional disciplines, when taken together, will offer insight on the established and innovative combination of youth-focused events that are already popular in Japan. In totality, the Tokyo 2020 President Yoshiro Mori said the games are to inspire the youth to achieve their best in sport and in life. What exercises can you do to relieve sciatica and leg pain?

| | | | | | | | | | | Sea ice formerly covered millions of square miles of both the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. In a warming world it is melting rapidly. This should be of great concern, as it is a valuable habitat for many marine mammals and organisms. In addition is is one of many feedback loops that accelerate climate change. Sea ice being white in colour had a high albedo, i.e. it reflects a lot of the suns energy back into space. When it melts and is replaced by sea water, which is much darker in colour and has a much lower albedo, more of the suns energy is absorbed, accelerating the warming, and further accelerating the melting of the remaining sea ice.

SNP & Variation Suite VS-CNV Align & Variant Calling Pharmaceutical R&D Date: Wednesday, May 3, 2017 Presenter: Jingga Inlora, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Stanford University Duration: ACCESS THIS WEBCAST : Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have brought a paradigm shift in how researchers investigate common and rare diseases. While whole genome sequencing remains costly, whole exome sequencing (WES) is less expensive and has recently been introduced into clinical practices such as disease treatment, screening and prenatal diagnosis. Recent success of WES has uncovered numerous disease-causing mutations and disease-predisposing variants throughout the genome. Here we report four cases of Mendelian disorders observed in affected families. Using WES and bioinformatics techniques, we identified variants in each disease case, which co-segregates with the disease and are compatible with the phenotype. Dr. Jingga Inlora is a postdoctoral fellow in the Snyder lab. Her research focuses on using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify rare heritable mutations in Mendelian disorders. Using similar technology, she also studies how environmental exposures, in particular, air-borne microorganisms, affect human health. Dr. Inlora received her PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor in 2015 where she studied the assembly process of HIV-1 particles and the evolution of retroviruses. Dr. Inlora’s abstract focused on identifying genetic variants associated with rare Mendelian diseases.

Skeggy said: dredknight said: This will render Inferno absolutely unplayable (early game will be very tough with many casualties) due to the sheer reason their units are weak in HP and much of the whole stack is reduced by a single hit. Doesn't matter if the inferno will be unplayable if that issue can be fixed with different creature health math. If game behavior, concerning these two examples, isn’t hardcoded, that would really be nice logical improvement that would make this gamemod even more popular. I dont think removing the 1 unit-slot will make the game better. it will actually reduce the number of tactical decisions in battle. Actually removing the 1 unit stack creates more issues than fixing such. If you want to really make that change you need to revamp the whole battle system. One example for new unit battle behavior is to have different speed/initiative for each stack depending on number of creatures in it. This speed/initiative filters will be justified by the formation the units take because of their numbers: 0-10 populations - normal stats (for example 11 init, 6 speed in all directions). 11-20 populations - (6 speed front, 3 speed left/right, 1 speed behind). 20+ populations - (4 speed front, 1 speed all other sides, -1 init penalty due to huge size). This way mages can bet on small armies that manuever easier while Might heroes can bring big tough armies which are slow due to their size. It will make the game more immersive. Another idea based on population in army is Moral bonus. When 2 armies fight there will be moral bonus and penalty based on different army strength. If army A is way stronger than army B it will have moral bonus while army B will have moral penalty and so on. Unfortunately those things will require completely new rewritten game from the ground as a lot of the things (spells, units, stats, progression) will take different approach due to the new system specifications. ____________ Find an opponent at HoMM55 Tavern! | | Send E-Mail | | | posted December 27, 2016 04:36 PM I have never got any reports about people playing h55 with chaining gameplay. It is not a viable way to play armg maps with regular settings because the pressure on gold is far too high. In h3 it is much more common, but people choose to play that way by playing the game on maps like jebus with ridiculous amounts of free stuff and trivial neutral resistance. I'm sure VCMI can change the tavern rules but apparantly people want to play like that. In h55 blocking stacks are already taken into account with very strong neutral resistance, so it is not a cheat it is a necessity to survive on higher difficulty. ____________ MMH5.5 Downloads | MMH5.5 Translations | MMH5.5 FAQ | Send E-Mail | | | posted December 31, 2016 01:43 PM at 13:51, 31 Dec 2016. Hey magno, I'd like to propose some changes for Academy creatures, which I believe would make the faction true-er to itself. As we know Academy faction is (supposed to be) all about mages, their experiments on living subjects (Gremlins and Rakshasas), their experiments on non-living subjects (Gargoyles, Golems and Giants) and their magical alliances (Djinn). What feels wrong now is that for some creatures, the creature types currently do not match their back story and lore. 1) Gargoyles: They're correctly described as "statues of flying creatures animated by magic" but in the game, they're "Elemental". I really do not think the type "Elemental" should be used this lightly, and it certainly does not fit the Gargoyles. 2) Djinn: They're described as "ancient elemental spirits" with "magical essence" but they're regarded as "living creatures" by the game. That's categorically wrong. They don't even leave a corpse behind (naturally, because they're magical elemental spirits!). 3) Giants: Although they're also "magically animated" from non-living substance, the game treats them as "living creatures". That's also categorically wrong. Their description is trying too hard to make them into a living being but that's just wrong. So, what's my proposal? 1) Make Gargoyles, Golems and Giants into mechanical creature type, but rename the type to "Animated". The major change would be for the Giants. They will receive some benefits - immunity to Poison and Blind (they already are immune to mind control) - but they will lose the feature of being able to be healed or resurrected. On the other hand, they (along with Gargoyles) can now be repaired by Master Gremlins, or crippled by enemy Gremlin Saboteurs (if they pass the total HP test). 2) To assist in repairing the animated constructs (Gargoyles, Golems and Giants), give all the Mages (Tier 4) the ability "Repair". This only makes sense as the Mages animated them in the first place and should be able to repair them. Overall, I believe this should make up for the loss of healing and resurrection on the Giants. 3) Make the Djinn into the type "Elemental" as this is really what they are. I believe the gained immunities and lost healing/resurrection features are very balanced for this creature, and it would make them even more interesting. As a side note, "Djinn Vizier" should really be renamed into "Djinn Shah" or "Djinn Malik" because Vizier and Sultan are not equal titles: a Vizier would always be beneath a Sultan. Edit: I'd like to include the Phoenix into my proposal... Make them into "Elemental" type, because again that's really what they are, as opposed to living creatures. | Send E-Mail | | | posted December 31, 2016 03:46 PM at 15:47, 31 Dec 2016. thGryphn said: What feels wrong now is that for some creatures, the creature types currently do not match their back story and lore. Gargoyles, golems and giants (3g’s) are hybrid creatures by default regardless of energy they carry, since they first have to be physically created and then imbued with some energy or connected with some plane. There's nothing wrong with gargoyles being elemental. They can be elemental even if they are made from stone. Lore consistency has nothing to do with how some creatures, 3g’s in this instance, are defined. It’s not only about from what they are made, it’s also about how they are made, or in other words, what makes them move. For instance: All gargoyle types can be either elemental or mechanical, it depends what makes them move; is it connection to elemental plains, is it some sort of battery energy so they can have only limited amounts of moves so they don’t need connection with any plane of existence, or is it some sort of hybrid mechanization that allows them to be mechanized and have unlimited moves, but doesn’t necessarily demands fully active connection with other planes of existence. Perhaps that passive connection, not necessarily with other full-fledged planes but perhaps some intertwined border zones is why wizards are so perceptually interesting as a faction. It is legitimate to assume that Djinns are self-aware so they can connect themselves with every plane they want. It is also legitimate to assume that 3g’s can also be connected to undead planes of existence. Perhaps that’s the hidden reason for great war between wizards and necromancers? It’s a good reason to create strange maps with strange, yet lore-consistent creatures. I suppose it would be nice if wizards could have repair ability. | Send E-Mail | | | Rebirth aanytime now.. posted December 31, 2016 03:57 PM Djinns fit as elementals just as gargoyles fit as constructs but I'm not sure I agree on the rest. Mechanical titans seems reasonable but that would be a serious nerf to light academy builds. Repairing mages is a good idea but I'm pretty sure that it cannot in any way make up for spammable motw + regeneration/resurrection. Elemental phoenixes sounds fine but the gameplay would lose some spell combos due to immunity to regeneration, resurrection, raise dead, wasp swarm(and by extension hive) and I think vampirism also?

Phoenixes will become too much of an annoyance on the adventure map. The current gameplay would be completely altered of course for Academy, but not necessarily for the worse. Of course, some creatures like the Djinn (+HP?) and Master Gremlin (-Initiative?) may require some stats changes for rebalancing. I didn't ask the question then but, is it possible to add "Repair" as a hero spell? If not, it can be given to the Djinn as an ability too. Yes, it would be quite the change but you can't convince me that it wouldn't be viable after some rethinking of the faction and rebalancing. I argue it would be more interesting than the current Light + Academy builds. If you don't buy in the idea, of course you won't devote the effort to make it viable. But I certainly understand what you're saying, basically that it's not in the scope of this mod (don't fix it if it ain't broke) Edit: Phoenix, yeah, the more annoying, the more interesting to fight against.

I would certainly agree if Phoenix was a faction creature... Maybe it's just me but I would like to see the Phoenix as an uber-creature, extremely rare and ultimately formidable. I would even increase its stats from current values. Something like how the Azure Dragon was Edit: No, I'm not going for a Boss creature like in H6.

So I leave it completely. Also all my tier 8 creatures would have had strengths and weaknesses. Alright, not gonna insist I have a totally different question: Is the fact that Empowered spells dealing 50% more damage dealt with by the game engine, or do the xdb files play a role? I'm asking because there might be an inconsistency with Empowered Deep Freeze when you look at the xdb file... Also related question: are Empowered spells supposed to inflict 50% more damage regardless of the mastery level? Edit: Looking through the game files, I really think Empowered Deep Freeze is handled differently from other Empowered spells because it also deals damage for a duration of turns, which is equal to 1 + SpellPower. I really think you should take a look at this spell, I think it's not working as you probably think it does Similar thing with Empowered Stone Spikes... I'm not sure it actually does 50% more damage, as it should.

Extracts from "My Life as a Dog", The autobiography of Johnny Alpha, as told to Mike Butcher. WAS born in 2150, just after the Great War that left Britain a nuclear wasteland with only 30% survivors. My mother was Diana Kreelman. I guess you could say that my father was a freak strontium storm that she was caught in before I was born. That was what caused my mutation and changed my life before it had even begun. Unfortunately, my real father was much worse than any radioactive storm. He was Nelson Bunker Kreelman, Civic Leader in New Britain's South West Sector and pioneer of the harsh new anti-mutant legislation. Not suprisingly, I never saw even-to-eye with my father. There were far too many alpha waves coming from my eyes for his liking. He kept my mutant eyes a closely-guarded secret, as he built his political career on ever more rabid mutant bashing. I was practically confined to the house throughout my early childhood. No-one told me I was a mutant. I really believed I had a dangerous eye condition that could prove fatal if ever exposed to the light. It was only when I had to attend school that I discovered the truth about my eyes. Some of the pupils decided to rough me up a bit and pull off my special goggles. They regretted picking on me when they say what was underneath. Me, I was delighted. I wasn't dead. In fact I had special powers I'd never dreamt of. I rushed off to tell my dad. I thought he's be delighted, too. Fat chance! He was furious. If word got out about my mutation his career would've been over, so he made me a prisoner at home. That's when I truly learnt to hate my father. I'd always felt he resented me for some reason. Now I knew why - I was a mutant. He'd fought long and hard to pass laws that made it illegal for mutants to own anything, to work, or even to live among 'norms'. All along, he'd had a mutant living under his own roof'. I decided to escape from my father's house. I'd heard stories about a rebel Mutant Army, fighting for mutant rights, l figured that if joined them I might be able to put right some of the terrible things Kreelman had done. I suppose I must have seemed pretty crazy to the rebels. there I was, 12 years old and full of hate, begging to join to roughest, toughest band in the South West Sector. I couldn't even tell them who I was. I said my name was Johnny Alpha, and they accepted me into their ranks. Kreelman was happy to believe that I was dead, while I swiftly became a leading figure in the Mutant Army. I led my first guerrilla raid at the age of 14 and by 2167 1 was second-in-command of the whole unit. But then our struggle became all the more desperate. Kreelman set up the Mutant Labour Camps, where mutants were subjected to slave labour and horrendous living conditions. The Mutant Armies from all the different sectors of New Britain held a joint meeting and we discussed tactics for war! It was decided we should attack the floating fortress at Upminister and try to seize control of the Government. Despite heavy losses, we won. Unfortunately Kreelman escaped and then forced us to surrender by threatening to kill 100 mutants every hour. We thought surrender was the best option, as the King and Prime Minister seemed a little sympathetic to our cause. However we reckoned without the depth of my father's influence and I was sentenced to death, along with the other mutant generals. Then the Mutant Extermination Bill was passed and we had to fight back. Ironically, it was my sister whom I hadn't seen for years, who played a key part in my father's downfall. First she helped me and the other generals escape our execution. Then she revealed the truth about Kreelman's mutie son to the Prime Minister and King. This game them the ammunition they needed to discredit my father and force him to resign. The Mutant Army did the rest. We struggled hard to cause maximum disruption to the Mutant Extermination Programme. The Prime Minister was keen to settle with us so the Bill was abolished, my father's secret police, the Kreelers were disbanded and new areas were set out where mutants could live in peace. We were a long way from equality with the 'norms', but the Kreelman era was over. I was exiled off-planet, which suited me. I'd had enough of Earth and the people who lived there. Then the Galactic Crime Commission set up an agency for interplanetary bounty hunters, or Search/Destroy Agents. It was a dirty and dangerous job, ideal for mutants,' according to the 'norms'. I joined right away. It wasn't long before we were known by our more common name - the Strontium Dogs!

Then prog 1300 (summer 2002) had Wulf and Johnny Alpha back in old school black & white art. (this is from prog 1305) Colonel X's 2000AD Guide Johnny Alpha has appeared in many specials, annuals. And in the occasionally Judge Dredd crossovers like 'Judgement Day' and 'Top Dog' although well-written, in my opinion these crossovers are don't fit with either timeline.

| In the past several years, Power Quality has become an issue that affects virtually everyone. With our world becoming ever more tech dependant, poor power quality can be disastrous and symptoms not always obvious. Many of the homes and businesses in the Santa Barbara area were built before we recognized and understood how to wire for good Power Quality. A few of the common power quality issues we see in this area is voltage sags and spikes, blackouts/brownouts, transients, and high harmonic loads. Fortunately these are almost always correctable when addressed by a properly trained technician using the necessary test equipment. Even EMF (Electro- Magnetic Fields) which has received much attention recently can be abated but only by someone who has the specialized knowledge and experience to deal with this complex issue. Here at Howe Electric, we offer several flat-rate testing/rectification packages. Depending on your specific needs, we can also arrange a custom package. We offer a very competitive pricing structure and encourage our customers to compare our prices with other electrical contractors offering similar services. Call today for your free phone consultation.

What's a Reddie? What's a Reddie? It can be a little hard to describe, but when you're here it’s not hard to understand. What is a Reddie? Being a Reddie… living that Reddie Spirit… carrying that Reddie pride with you during your years at Henderson State University and throughout the rest of your life. It’s something special. Upon its establishment in 1905, the Henderson State football team became known for wearing red jerseys. Absent a traditional nickname or mascot, the team was appropriately dubbed the “Reds.” Eventually, the name shifted to “Reddies,” and it stuck. Being a Reddie is about much more than athletics, and involves a level of pride that could never fit into a silly, furry costume. In 1914, the Henderson State campus was ravaged by a fire. With nearly the entire campus destroyed, a group of Henderson students gathered under a tree with a decision to make — either transfer to other schools in the area, or rebuild Henderson. In the end, the choice was easy. They decided to rebuild Henderson, and at that moment, they redefined what a “Reddie” truly was. So, when someone asks you “What’s a Reddie?” you can tell them… it’s a spirit. It’s a belief. It’s an attitude. It’s a Henderson thing.

Methods: Using MEDLINE and Google Scholar search, we searched for studies investigating the therapeutic success of ketogenic diet for epilepsy. We estimated therapeutic success rate for ketogenic diet as a treatment option for epilepsy and its 95% CIs using generic inverse variance method. Findings: A total of 38 studies met the inclusion criteria. In retrospective studies, the weighted success rate of the patients who take the KD as a treatment option for epilepsy was 58.4%  (95% confidence interval (95%CI)=48.7% - 69.9%) at 3 months  (n=336); 42.8%  (95%CI =36.3% - 50.3%) at 6 months  (n=492), and 30.1%  (95%CI =24.3% - 37.2%) at 12 months  (n=387); in prospective studies, weighted success rate was 53.9%  (95%CI 45.5% - 63.8%) at 3 months  (n=474); 53.2% (95%CI =44.0% - 64.2%) at 6 months  (n=321), and 55.0%  (95%CI =45.9% - 65.9%) at 12 months  (n=347). Conclusion: This meta-analysis provides formal statistical support for the efficacy of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of epileptic patients. 17/Nov/2013 Obese and Overweight Children and Adolescents: An Algorithmic Clinical Approach Zahra  Alizadeh, Shahrzad Khosravi, Sima Borna Obesity in children and adolescents is a hot issue throughout the world. Numerous complications are related to childhood obesity, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, insulin resistance and psychological problems. Therefore, identification and treatment of this problem have an important role in the health system. In this clinical approach, we have provided a general overview of the assess¬ment and management of obesity in children and adolescents, including definitions, history-taking, physical examinations, and laboratory testing for general practitioners and pediatricians. Furthermore, conventional therapies (physical activity, eating habits and behavioral modification) and non-conventional treatments (drugs and surgery options) have been discussed. 18/Nov/2013 Vinayak Y. Kshirsagar, Minhajuddin Ahmed, Sylvia  M. Colaco Objective: A high incidence of snake bite envenomation has been reported from rural India. Due to inadequate epidemiological data, the incidence is underestimated. This study analyses the pattern of snake bite and their management in children in rural areas of Maharashtra, India. To determine the age, mode of presentation, seasonal variation, clinical profile and outcome of patients with snake bite less than 15 years of age. Methods: This study is a retrospective, descriptive study including 162 patients, who presented with history of snake bite. Clinical data about age, sex, clinical manifestations, complications and outcome were obtained from case records and were analyzed. Findings: Out of the 162 patients 98 (60.49%) were males. The bites were vasculotoxic in 147 (90.74%) and neuroparalytic in 15 (9.25%) patients. Mainly bites occurred from July to September with 84 (51.85%) bites. Bites were more common in males in age more than 5 years (89%) with bite marks mainly on lower limbs in 120 (74.04%) patients. Deaths were reported in patients who reported late to the hospital with a mortality rate of 1.85%. Conclusion: Snake bite is a life threatening emergency. The key to minimizing mortality and severe morbidity is aggressive management of the ABC`s of resuscitation, and timely and judicious administration of adequate dose of anti-venom. 08/Nov/2013 Frequency of Shiga Toxin-Producing Genes of Escherichia Coli Isolated from Diarrheic Stools of Iranian Children by PCR Lida  Nasrollahi, Sedigheh Shams, Mohammad-Taghi Haghi-Ashtiani, Reza Shahsiah, Maryam Monajemzadeh, Behnoosh Tahbaz-Lahafi, Alireza Alaie-Alamooti Objective: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a pathogenic E. coli that may cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) after diarrheal disease through Shiga toxins. Management of the patients with STEC infection is different from that of other diarrheal diseases due to increase in frequency of HUS after antibiotic administration. Few studies were conducted in Iran and epidemiology of STEC remains obscure; this necessitates examination of stools especially in young children for this bacterium. Methods: We determined the frequency of STEC in 947 E. coli strains isolated from diarrheal stools of children less than 14 years in Tehran with conventional culture methods and multiplex-PCR via determining the STX1 and STX2 genes, between October 2008 and September 2009. We also evaluated the association between stool exam findings and presence of STEC. Findings: Twenty seven (2.8%) of E. coli isolates were positive for STX1 or STX2 genes, most of which occurred in spring (P<0.05). There was no significant association between STEC positivity and stool exam findings. Eighteen out of 27 (66.7%) Shiga toxin positive samples were isolated from males and the rest from females. The most common STX-positive diarrheal samples showed loose consistency (P<0.017). Conclusion: Although the low frequency of STEC in our population indicates that it is not a major problem in our population, STEC should be regarded as an important infection because of its severe consequences. Further studies with greater sample size are needed to confirm our results. 28/Sep/2013 Azita  Fesharakinia, Ali-Reza Ehsanbakhsh, Nasrin Ghorashadizadeh Objective: Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin which is widely used for treatment of infection in children accompanied by complications like urinary tract lithiasis and gallbladder psudolithiasis or sludge. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and predisposing factors that contribute to these complications in children. Methods: This quasi-experimental and before- and after-study was conducted in 96 children who were hospitalized for treatment of different bacterial infections and received 50-100 mg/kg/day ceftriaxone divided into two equal doses intravenously under conditions of adequate hydration. Sonographic examinations of urinary tract and gallbladder were carried out before and after treatment for that purpose. Patients with positive sonographic findings after treatment were followed with serial sonographic examinations. Findings: Post-treatment sonography demonstrated nephrolithiasis in 6 (6.3%) and gallbladder stone in one (1%), all were asymptomatic. Comparison of the groups with and without nephrolithiasis demonstrated no significant differences with respect to age, body weight, diagnosis, season of hospitalization, dosage of drug and the duration of treatment. Nephrolithiasis had a significant relation with male gender (P=0.02). Conclusion: Our results showed that pediatric patients may develop small sized, asymptomatic renal stones during a 2-6 day course of normal or moderate dose of ceftriaxone therapy. Close monitoring of ceftriaxone treated patients especially on high dose long term therapy for nephrolithiasis and gallbladder psudolithiasis or sludge is recommended. 09/Nov/2013 Protective Temporary Vesicostomy for Upper Urinary Tract Problems in Children: A Five-Year Experience Alireza  Mirshemirani, Mohsen  Rouzrokh, Ahmad Khaleghnejad-Tabari, Naser  Sadeghian, Leily Mohajerzadeh, Maesomeh Mohkam Objective: Temporary vesicostomy is a urinary diversion procedure for patients with upper urinary tract (UUT) dilatation, secondary to bladder outlet obstruction or dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate our experience in children undergoing such diversion, analyzing its efficacy to prevent urinary tract infection (UTI), improve or resolve hydronephrosis, stabilize or improve kidney function and restore the health of UUT. Methods: In this retrospective study, patients who had vesicostomy by Blocksom technique due to bladder outlet obstruction or dysfunction were evaluated in Mofid Children's Hospital (in Tehran) from March 2007 to March 2012. The reason for applying this procedure was failure in clinical treatment. Data regarding gender, age, diagnosis, time of any surgical intervention, associated anomalies, primary/secondary complications and mortality were collected using a questionnaire, and evaluated by giving a grade that ranged from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) based on Lickert's scale. Findings: From a total number of 53 patients, (88.7% male and 11.3% female) with a mean age of 225 days, 66% had posterior urethral valve and 16 (30%) neurogenic bladder. UTI was present in all cases, hydronephrosis in 52 (98.1%), and vesico-ureteral reflux only in 45 (84.9%) patients. Valve ablation was performed in 17 cases, and clean intermittent catheterization in14 patients which were unsuccessful. We performed vesicostomy in all patients. Mortality rate was 7.5%. Vesicostomy was closed in 35 patients. Cure rate was 85% in UTI, 82.7% in hydronephrosis, 80% in VUR, and 86.5% in kidney function. Conclusion: Vesicostomy is a simple procedure that protects upper urinary tract, decreases hydronephrosis, and improves kidney function. The procedure is well tolerated and reversible, with less complication and should be considered in children in whom conservative and medical treatment has failed. 22/Nov/2013 Mahmoud-Reza Ashrafi, Mohammad-Mahdi  Taghdiri, Mohammad-Kazem  Bakhshandeh-Bali, Seyedeh-Mohadeseh Taheri-Otaghsara, Mohammad-Mahdi Nasehi, Mohammad Ghofrani Objective: Approximately one-third of all children with epilepsy do not achieve complete seizure improvement. This study evaluated the efficacy of Vigabatrin in children with intractable epilepsy. Methods: From November 2011 to October 2012, 73 children with refractory epilepsy (failure of seizure control with the use of two or more anticonvulsant drugs) who were referred to the Children’s Medical Center and Mofid Children’s Hospital were included in the study. The patients were treated with Vigabatrin in addition to their previous medication, and followed-up after three to four weeks to determine the daily frequency, severity, and duration of seizures in addition to any reported side effects. Findings: Of the 67 children, 41 (61.2%) were males and 26 (38.8%) females, their age ranging from three months to 13 years with an average of 3.1 [standard deviation (SD), 2.6] years. The mean daily frequency of seizures at baseline was 6.61 (SD, 5.9) seizures per day. Vigabatrin reduced the seizure frequency ≤2.9 (SD, 5.2) (56% decline) and 3.0 (SD, 5.3) (54.5% decline) per day after three and six months of treatment, respectively. A significant difference was observed between seizure frequencies at three (P<0.001) and six months (P<0.001) after Vigabatrin initiation compared with the baseline. Somnolence [3 (4.5%)], horse laugh [1 (1.5%)], urinary stones [1 (1.5%)], increased appetite [1 (1.5%)], and abnormal electroretinographic pattern [3 (4.5%)] were the most common side effects in our patients. Conclusion: This study confirms the short-term efficacy and safety of Vigabatrin in children with refractory epilepsies. 03/Nov/2013 Manizheh  Mostafa-Gharehbaghi, Sina Davari Farid, Naiere Najati, Ali Ghorbani Haghjo, Morteza Ghojazadeh Objective: Placental hormones such as resistin, adiponectin, ghrelin and leptin are known to have considerable role in fetal growth and there are some articles published in this area recently. Nevertheless there is a shortage of data showing association between resistin level and fetal growth; that was why we decided to conduct a study to evaluate this association. Methods: This study was approved by ethic committee of pediatric health research center and research vice chancellor of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. In this case-control study we measured the insulin, glucose and resistin in the cord blood of neonates with gestational age of 37 weeks or more in Al Zahra tertiary hospital from March 2011 to March 2012. Thirty-nine appropriate for gestation age (AGA) neonates and 41 small for gestation age (SGA) neonates were studied. Findings: The umbilical cord blood resistin level was not found to have significant correlation with the type of delivery [normal vaginal delivery (NVD) or cesarean-section (C-S)], neonate's gender, maternal age or body mass index (BMI). There was no significant difference in the levels of Insulin and glucose between AGA and SGA groups. Resistin level of blood cord in AGA group was 613.76±180.10 (range: 132.6-983.80 ng/ml) and in SGA group it was 1303.47±537.07 (range: 800.9-3001 ng/ml) (P<0.001). Neonates’ weight in AGA group was 3162.82±407.92 g and in SGA group it was 2425.85±32.84 g (P<0.001). Conclusion: In this study resistin level had reverse correlation with fetal weight in term neonates. The SGA neonates with growth insufficiency have higher resistin levels in their cord blood than AGA neonates with same gestational age. It is recommended to conduct more studies in future with larger population of patients to clarify the resistin role in neonatal birth weight. 23/Nov/2013 Nooshin Shirzad, Avisa Tabib, Sara Sheikhbahaei, Sara Mohammadi, Mostafa Qorbani, Vahid Haghpanah, Farzaneh Abbasi, Shirin  Hasani-Ranjbar, Ramin Baghaei-Tehrani Objective: In this study we aimed to determine the prevalence of cardiac malformations in fetuses of Iranian diabetic mothers with pre-gestational and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to find the patterns of different cardiac malformations. Methods: One-hundred and seventy diabetic pregnant women (68 preGDM and 102 GDM) (mean age: 32.17±4.8 years) and 85 healthy controls (mean age: 31.35±4.55 years) were recruited from September 2008 to July 2012. Fetal echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac malformation. In order to study major factors that may affect the results, a complete history was obtained. Findings: Fetal echocardiography was performed at mean gestational age of 24.7±5.4 and 20.27±3.9 weeks in diabetic patients and control group, respectively. Fifteen (8.8%) fetuses of diabetic mothers were detected to have cardiac malformations compared with 1 (1.17%) fetus in control group (OR: 8.13, 95%CI: 1.1-62.61,      P-value=0.02). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy noted as the most common cardiac malformation occurred in 6 out of 15 (40%) fetuses, and was found significantly more common in pre-GDM compared to GDM group (7.4% vs 1%, P-value =0.04). Despite the higher incidence of cardiac malformation in pre-GDM compared to GDM group, the difference was not significant. Further, no significant association was observed between the variables including; parity, diabetic regimen, parents’ consanguinity, maternal history of hypertension or hypothyroidism and occurring cardiac malformations (P-value >0.05). Conclusion: In this study we detected cardiac malformations in 8.8% of our diabetic referrals. The result of the present study shows that screening diabetic mothers for fetal cardiac malformations could be beneficial. 27/Nov/2013 Effects of Probiotics on Quality of Life in Children with Cystic Fibrosis; A Randomized Controlled Trial Atieh Mehdizadeh-Hakkak, Seyed-Ali Jafari, Hamid-Reza Kianifar, Paria Hebrani, Hamid Ahanchian, Elaheh  Abbasnejad Objective: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) usually have abnormal intestinal microbiota and dysregulated immune mediators due to massive exposure to antibiotics. Probiotics as immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory substances are considered to improve both clinical and biochemical intestinal and pulmonary function in CF patients. We decided to investigate the effects of probiotics on quality of life and pulmonary exacerbations in children with cystic fibrosis. Methods: In a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial, 37 CF patients (2-12 years old) were randomly divided into two groups. 20 patients of probiotic group took probiotics (2×109CFU/d) for one month while 17 patients of control group took placebo capsules. Quality of life was determined using PedsQLTM4.0 questionnaire at the beginning, then three and six months after completing the treatment period. Rate of pulmonary exacerbation in probiotic group patients was also evaluated during three months after intervention and compared to the same three months of the previous year. Results were analyzed using SPSS (11.5). P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Findings: Significant improvement was observed in the mean total score of parent reported quality of life among probiotic group patients in comparison with placebo group at 3rd month (P=0.01), but this was not significant at 6th month of probiotic treatment. Rate of pulmonary exacerbation was significantly reduced among probiotic group (P<0.01). Conclusion: Probiotics are considered as useful nutritional supplements on reducing number of pulmonary exacerbations and improving quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis. Effects of probiotics seem to be temporary and probably continuous ingestion might have more stable improving effects on quality of life. 27/Nov/2013 Neonatal Resuscitation in the Delivery Room from a Tertiary Level Hospital: Risk Factors and Outcome Seyyed-Abolfazl Afjeh, Mohammad-Kazem Sabzehei, Fatemeh Esmaili Objective: Timely identification and prompt resuscitation of newborns in the delivery room may cause a decline in neonatal morbidity and mortality. We try to identify risk factors in mother and fetus that result in birth of newborns needing resuscitation at birth. Methods: Case notes of all deliveries and neonates born from April 2010 to March 2011 in Mahdieh Medical Center (Tehran, Iran), a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, were reviewed; relevant maternal, fetal and perinatal data was extracted and analyzed. Findings: During the study period, 4692 neonates were delivered; 4522 (97.7%) did not require respiratory assistance. One-hundred seven (2.3%) newborns needed resuscitation with bag and mask ventilation in the delivery unit, of whom 77 (1.6%) babies responded to bag and mask ventilation while 30 (0.65%) neonates needed endotracheal intubation and 15 (0.3%) were given chest compressions. Epinephrine/volume expander was administered to 10 (0.2%) newborns. In 17 patients resuscitation was continued for >10 mins. There was a positive correlation between the need for resuscitation and following risk factors: low birth weight, preterm labor, chorioamnionitis, pre-eclampsia, prolonged rupture of membranes, abruptio placentae, prolonged labor, meconium staining of amniotic fluid, multiple pregnancy and fetal distress. On multiple regression; low birth weight, meconium stained liquor and chorioamnionitis revealed as independent risk factors that made endotracheal intubation necessary. Conclusion: Accurate identification of risk factors and anticipation at the birth of a high-risk neonate would result in adequate preparation and prompt resuscitation of neonates who need some level of intervention and thus, reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality. 10/Dec/2013 Prevalence of ETV6/RUNX1 Fusion Gene in Pediatric Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Iran Ahmad-Reza Rahnemoon, Farhad Zaker, Mina Izadyar, Shahla Ansari, Behzad Poopak, Yuri Tadavosyan Objective: ETV6/RUNX1 (also known as TEL/AML1) is the most frequent gene fusion in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Sixty-three patients were enrolled in this study to explore the distribution of this gene in Iranian population. Methods: This study used 63 peripheral blood and bone marrow (PB/BM) samples from children with ALL. Immunophenotyping of PB and BM samples were performed using flow cytometry to illustrate the lineage. Moreover, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used to amplify transcripts of leukemia-specific chromosome fusion gene ETV6/RUNX1 and to monitor the expression levels of the ETV6/RUNX1 in patients according to Van Dongen et al protocol. Findings: On the basis of French-American-British (FAB) classification, 47 individuals had ALL-L1. The incidence of ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene in this study was 34.9%. The laboratory and clinical features of twenty two ETV6/RUNX1 positive ALL cases were similar to those of other studies. The most positive cases of ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene had the early pre B ALL and pre B ALL immunophenotypes. Conclusion: The ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene is a common genetic anomaly in Iranian childhood ALL patients and the prevalence of the ETV6/RUNX1 fusion gene is similar to that of ALL patients in other countries. However early pre B cells were the most common type in studied patients. 22/Nov/2013 Cardiac Repolarization Changes in the Children with Breath-Holding Spells Hamid  Amoozgar, Fazl Saleh, Nahal Farhani, Mohammad Rafiei, Soroor  Inaloo, Ali-Akbar Asadipooya Objective: Breath-holding spells are known as benign attacks, frequencies of which decrease by the development of the autonomic nervous system. The present study aims to compare the electrocardiographic repolarization in children with breath-holding spells. Methods: In this study, QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, T peak to T end dispersion, and P wave dispersion of the twelve-lead surface electrocardiography of fifty children who had breath-holding spells were measured and compared with normal children from April 2011 to August 2012. Findings: Forty-four (88%) patients had cyanotic spells, while 6 (12%) had pallid spells. QTc dispersion was increased in the patients with breath-holding spells (148.2±33.1) compared to the healthy children (132±27.3) and the difference was statically significant (P=0.01). Meanwhile, no statistically significant differences were observed between the patients and the control subjects regarding the other parameters (P>0.05). Conclusion: QTc dispersion was significantly increased in the patients with breath-holding spells compared to normal children and this is a sign of cardiac repolarization abnormality as well as the increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia in patients with breath-holding spells. 22/Nov/2013 Mehmet Yekta Oncel, Sema Arayici, Gulsum Kadioglu Simsek, Erhan Calisici, Omer Erdeve, Nurdan Uras, Serife Suna Oguz, Ugur Dilmen Objective: To determine the risk factors associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) related hospitalizations in preterm infants receiving palivizumab throughout the high season for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods: Premature infants who were commenced on palivizumab prophylaxis during the RSV season were included in the study following parental consent. Information on demographic, social, prenatal and postnatal clinical characteristics was recorded and risk factors associated with hospitalization were evaluated for each patient. Findings: While 234 participants (Group 1, 92.8%) did not require hospitalization during the study period, 18 patients (Group 2, 7.2%) were hospitalized at least once for LRTI during the RSV season. The rate of moderate-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was significantly higher in group 2 compared to group 1 (38.9% vs 16.2%; P=0.016). Of the 18 infants who were hospitalized, 6 (33.3%) tested positive for RSV while the remaining 12 patients (66.7%) were negative for RSV. Odds ratio (OR) analysis of several risk factors revealed the presence of BPD (OR: 3.28; 95%CI: 1.19-9), being from a family with low socioeconomic status (OR: 3.64; 95%CI 1.08-12.3) to be associated with a higher likelihood of LRTI-related hospitalization. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that RSV is an important LRTI agent and cause of hospitalization especially in preterm infants with additional risks such as BPD, gestational age of <28 weeks and low socioeconomic status. We suggest that improving care conditions and decreased BPD with prematurity would help in prevention of LRTI hospitalization. 25/Sep/2013 Ahmad Khosravi, Reza Chaman, Mohammad Amiri, Mehdi Raei, Mohammad-Esmaeil Ajami, Afsaneh Sadeghian Objective: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) and its related risk factors in an appropriate sample of neonates in Shahroud, northeast Iran. Methods: At this study, a random sample of 1000 neonates were selected of which 72 neonates were LBWs. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods to evaluate the LBW risk factors in LBWs compared to normal weight infants. Findings: 7.2% of neonates were LBWs and 6.1% born before 37 weeks of gestation. Prematurity, high-risk pregnancy and maternal age have significant statistical association with LBW. Odds Ratio (OR) for prematurity was 42.82 (95%CI; 21.93-83.57), for high risk pregnancy 2.76 (95%CI; 1.47-5.19) and for maternal age group more than 35 years in comparison to 19-35 years age group 0.2 (95%CI; 0.05-0.71). Conclusion: Based on this study; prematurity and high risk pregnancy were the most important risk factors for LBW. There was also a reverse association between maternal age and LBW. 28/Jul/2013 Salih Kavukcu, Alper Soylu 20/Nov/2013 Khatuna  Kudava, Tina Kituashvili, Manana Sekania, George Galdava 14/Sep/2013 Recurrent Gallbladder Hydrops and Sclerosing Cholangitis in 11-Year-Old Male with Hyper IgM Syndrome Kambiz  Eftekhari, Mehri  Najafi, Mohammad-Ali Kiani, Asghar Aghamohammadi 27/Jul/2013 Keyhan Sayadpour Zanjani, Ehsan Aghaei-Moghadam, Yazdan  Ghandi 20/Jul/2013 Negar Sajjadian, Paymaneh Alizadeh-Taheri, Bahareh Eivazzadeh 18/Oct/2013 K  JAGADISHKUMAR, Vaddambal G.

If you think the largest democracy in the world is the USA, you are wrong. By all official records it is India with 650 million electorates choosing 541 representatives. The USA, sole post-cold war super power, comes second and the difference is very large. We Indians are very happy and also proud about this fact. For more than two months Indian media is printing and talking about the country's General Elections, now underway peacefully (from April 20th till May 10th). Indian media is also abuzz with elections in America. So we expect similar coverage of our elections in Western media. But what is happening actually? When we get e-mails from our friends - now NRI's- abroad, asking us fervent questions about the elections back home, we are surprised. They don't know anything about The General Elections here. The Western media didn't pay attention to our elections, particularly before the first phase of the elections. How come? For the Western media, the 'Largest Democracy' is the USA. News items about   the Preliminaries in the USA are filling columns and columns in Europeans papers.   On the contrary, Indian newspapers, weeklies etc. devote much space to happenings   in Europe. May it concern environment, fashion, politics, anything. USA is   our favorite subject. (Remember how we flashed Bill Clinton's visit on front   page?) Then why is this ignorance about Indian Elections? As far as Europe   is concerned, one can understand their stand. Compared to USA and UK, very   few Indians are staying in Europe. And perhaps Europeans are more inclined   to live in their own world. But that is also hardly palatable or digestible.   Going with the principle of journalism, media is supposed to cover all the   important happenings around us. And yet, Indian Elections 2004 don't find much   space in European media. Still, we can accept (with much effort) the reason   stated above, for ignoring this vast democratic exercise. But what about the USA and the UK? In the UK, there are almost 1.05 million   Indian-British, which account for 1.8 percent of UK's population. Nearly five   decades ago many left their home and homeland to reconstruct the post war Britain.   In a desire for a better life, they swallowed bitter taste of racism, they   own people; they coped up with an alien society, which was interested more   in their labor than in their welfare in their evening years. Their children   usually do very well in education, but hardly find a good job. The grim reality   remains after so many years. Unemployment among Indians in the UK. is 7.5 percent,   as compared 4.5 percent in white Britain. Many Indians are working on low wages.   So the presence of Indians or those of Indian origin is 'felt' but ignored.   It is perhaps a legacy of colonization. In the USA, Indians are doing much better thanks to the IT sector. Indians   settled there are now thinking of entering mainstream US politics. Few of them   are contesting in the elections also. In sum, Indians in the USA are quite   influential. And yet again, US media don't bother to report about the Indian   General Elections. They are more occupied with their own elections, the 9/11   incident and the enquiry related to it, deaths of American soldiers in Iraq,   etc.. And Indians themselves in the USA and the UK were busier with the India-Pakistan   cricket matches than with the elections. They are not to be blamed entirely.   Indians residing outside India cannot vote, so they do not participate in the   process of elections in India (there is a large segment in India who rarely   vote, the bulk of expatriates belong to this class, upper middle, rich generally).   Another reason is, I believe, that the Indian media, through their internet   editions, or net-based news services, have failed in creating a kind of curiosity   about the elections. The central government of India, in a run-up for the mid-term general elections,   ran a big campaign called 'India Shining' (handled by an international advertising   agency). The overt aim of the campaign was to propagate India's achievements   and the covert goal was to promote BJP, the main party of the ruling coalition.   good investment destination. People who are interested in investment in India,   don't need this kind of a campaign, so they are not interested. Indians residing   outside India are also not interested in it, as the issues are of local importance.   So the campaign may have projected an improved image of India, but failed to   generate interest in Indian elections. The full version of this article is available in the print edition.

Innovative Minds © 2014. All Rights Reserved. www.inminds.co.uk [ Boycott - Arms ] In Tense Times, Israeli Arms Biz Booms Neal Sandler, BusinessWeek Growing demand for cutting-edge unmanned airplanes and military electronics equipment are contributing to record revenues Israel is the world's fourth-largest arms supplier after the U.S, Russia, and France. Military exports from the small Mideast nation rose 20% last year, to $4.2 billion, and Israeli arms suppliers signed a record $5 billion in new contracts in 2006. In an era of geopolitical tensions, worldwide defense budgets last year reached a staggering new threshold of $1.1 trillion—nearly half of that from the U.S. Lining up for its share of the business is Israel, the world's fourth-largest arms supplier after the U.S, Russia, and France. Military exports from the small Mideast nation rose 20% last year, to $4.2 billion, and Israeli arms suppliers signed a record $5 billion in new contracts in 2006. Israel's defense industry is benefiting from demand for its unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sophisticated electronic warfare equipment of the sort used in the ongoing Palestinian conflict and during last summer's war in Lebanon. "We're looking for defense exports to grow by a 20% annual clip at least through 2010," predicts Joshua Yeres, defense analyst at Giza Singer Even, an investment and consulting firm in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv. India Overtakes U.S. as Top Customer The arms industry gets about two-thirds of its business abroad, with sales to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accounting for the remainder. Some 90% of all export sales are accounted for by just four giants: publicly traded Elbit Systems (ESLT) and three state-owned companies, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), RAFAEL Armament Development Authority, and Israel Military Industries (IMI). The government doesn't reveal sales by country, but other sources suggest some intriguing trends. For decades, Israel's top arms customer was the U.S. But earlier this year, the Indian government released figures showing that in 2006 it bought $1.5 billion in weapons from Israel. That made New Delhi Israel's largest customer for the year, ahead of the No. 2 U.S. Among the deals: In November India is scheduled to take delivery of the first of three AWACS-type aerial reconnaissance planes, called Phalcons, that it ordered from IAI in a $1.1 billion deal. India has also purchased a Barak antimissile defense system, UAVs, and Israel's Green Pine missile-detection and tracking radar. Other major buyers of Israeli weapons and arms include Turkey, Singapore, Spain, Romania, and Poland. But sales to China, once a major customer, have been a source of tension between Jerusalem and Washington. In 2000 Israel was forced to cancel a lucrative sale of Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes because of Pentagon objections and had to pay $350 million in damages to Beijing for terminating the deal. More recently, Israel reshuffled senior Defense Ministry officials and agreed to tighten arms export regulations after the Pentagon complained about maintenance work on UAVs that Israel sold the Chinese a decade earlier. Sales to China have now resumed, though at lower levels than in the past. Precise figures aren't available. Demand elsewhere has more than offset the decline of the Chinese market. "We're witnessing an unprecedented rise in demand for advanced military electronics, and Israel is a recognized leader in this field," says Joseph Ackerman, chief executive officer of Elbit, the country's largest private sector defense company. That has paid off handsomely for Elbit. In 2005 the company won a landmark £700 million ($1.4 billion) joint-venture deal with Thales UK to supply Britain with its Hermes UAV. The growing global demand for its UAVs and sophisticated "command and control" computer intelligence equipment led to a doubling in 2006 of Elbit's net income, to $72.2 million, on revenues of $1.45 billion, up 42%. Earlier this month, investment bank UBS (UBS) predicted company revenues would reach $1.9 billion in 2007 with continued improvement in its bottom line. The company's stock price has nearly doubled in the past year. Israel's largest defense company, IAI, also has seen a big upswing. Defense industry experts attribute the results to its new CEO, Yitzhak Nissan, who took over in February, 2006. He has instituted a sharp cost-cutting campaign and boosted marketing. The company, which for years was only marginally profitable, reported a record $115 million net profit on sales of $2 billion in the first nine months of 2006—and booked more than $4 billion in new contracts. The upturn is due in large part to demand for IAI's larger UAV, called the Heron, which has been a big hit with the U.S. and India, and has been used in the Iraq war. It has also gained business from missiles, sophisticated electronic warfare equipment, and upgrade work on existing military planes owned by clients around the world. Earlier this month Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced that it was teaming up with IAI to build and launch small reconnaissance satellites based on the Israeli company's technology. The estimated cost of each satellite is put at $200 million. "This has huge potential for us in the American and other markets," says a senior IAI official. Another state-owned company, Rafael Armament Development Authority, also has seen a sharp increase in business. The once top-secret weapons development agency was converted into a standalone company several years ago to let it compete better in world markets. The developer of air, naval, and land-based rocket and weapons systems reported a net profit of $26 million on sales of just over $1 billion. The only Israeli company that has not joined in the boom is IMI, a maker of mostly small arms, including the Uzi submachine gun, grenades, and artillery and mortar ammunition. According to government sources, the company had 2006 sales of around $410 million, much of it in exports, but it is in such deep financial trouble that it hasn't issued financial statements in two years. The problem? Many countries are now producing their own ammunition, making it far more difficult for companies like IMI to survive. Last year the Israeli government decided to sell IMI in an attempt to keep it afloat, but so far the privatization process has met with little success. To rescue IMI, former senior defense industry official Avner Raz was appointed to be the company's new CEO on May 16. Increased demand from the Israeli Defense Forces following last summer's war in Lebanon is expected to help IMI out somewhat. But unless the financially strapped company transforms itself into a high-tech player like the other local defense giants, its chances of benefiting from the current export boom seem slim.

This may very well be the most powerful and dangerous ideology we have ever known because it is open-ended. This is liberalism."

Your tummy hurts. You have a terrible headache. You can’t sleep and you’re cranky. One more thing: you can’t ask for help because you’re only two weeks old! So you cry. And cry. And cry. Lacking the ability to speak, newborns cry, indicating that something isn’t right. And your parents feel helpless. Indigestion? Infantile colic was first thought to be merely indigestion. The most widely accepted definition of colic today is “unexplainable and uncontrollable crying in babies from 0 to 3 months old, more than 3 hours a day, more than 3 days a week for 3 weeks or more, usually in the afternoon and evening hours.” Birth Trauma? If a baby is inconsolable, it’s hard to know if it’s a digestive disturbance. Consider another explanation. Upon examination, we often find spinal cord stress in the baby’s upper neck region. These babies are probably suffering from head and neck pain. This is especially common if there was a difficult birth. A 67% Reduction in Crying tracked a small group of 50 infants. Half received the drug dimethicone and the other spinal manipulation. At the conclusion of the two-week study, the babies being adjusted saw a 67% reduction in crying and the drug therapy group saw a 38% reduction. Take the first step toward colic relief. Call today! While large scale research results are lacking, and colic is considered a condition that resolves on its own with the passage of enough time, there are many case studies showing improvement, sometimes dramatic, among colicky babies with subluxations. Chiropractic isn’t a treatment for colic! If stress in the spinal cord is present, interfering with the proper function of any part of the body, restoring proper nervous system control often allows the body to heal. This may happen regardless of age and regardless of what the particular symptoms are called. Consult our practice for a no-obligation consultation. Take action now and set up an appointment. Call or email us and put an end to the frustration and helplessness so many new mothers feel. Today's Chiropractic MDs Are MDs. DCs Are DCs. Why Fix It If It's Not Broken? MD Approval Needed?

POWER  SPOT--(POW er spot); a natural site where humans go in times of stress to find  comfort in the contemplation of something larger, greater, or more important  than themselves. Power  spots, by definition, cannot involve man-made structures.  It seems to me there are four other qualifying  characteristics, and I have listed them below in what I feel is the order of  their importance: Solitude.  Other words to substitute here might be  tranquility or peacefulness. Elevation.  Power spots are always higher than their  surroundings. Panorama.  There must be at least a 180 degree view,  preferably 360. Natural  beauty.  Think "scenic  overlook" without road access or traffic noise. If Arizona, with its deep  canyons and its stark mountains, doesn't lead the nation in power spots, it  surely deserves a prominent place in the conversation despite its dearth of  water and lack of coastline.  "Going  to the mountaintop" has biblical connotations, but I'm guessing every  calendar day finds a confirmed atheist and an evolutionary scientist at some  high place in Arizona,  though probably not together at the same time or at the same site. It is  mid-October.  The oak growing up from the  cliff face below me has turned to burnished gold and the sumac on the far slope  behind it is a blood red splotch.  The  Red-tail rises up, unannounced, above and behind the oak from somewhere in the  drainage thousands of feet below, riding a thermal created by the intersection  of morning's east wind with cliff's spectacular east facing rock walls, its  unmistakable buteo form kiting on the updraft, wavering without wingbeats, head  lowered as it searches for prey far below.   This is a classic Red-tail.  The  hawk is a fully adult bird appearing to have borrowed from oak and sumac,  perfectly mixing their palette of fall colors to paint the bright, burnt orange  tail feathers which are the signature fieldmark of its species. Conventional  wisdom holds that early October is the peak of southbound raptor migration  through Arizona.  I know we are a little late.  Evidence came yesterday at a different site  in central Arizona  where a friend once recorded 74 raptors in a single day, yet we saw only 14,  two of them Golden Eagles flying north, probably locals rather than  migrants.  Today, another typical magic  fall day in Arizona--warm  afternoons, cool nights, perfect blue skies--we are destined to see only  six.  But here on Aztec Peak  that's alright because the setting, the views, and autumn's radiant raiment  conspire to make the hawk watching almost incidental. Terrain  and weather, in that order, are everything to southbound raptors.  Conserving energy, as all but one of an  intelligent creator's creatures have evolved to do, migrating raptors will  follow coastlines and ridgelines where rising midday thermals afford them easy  passage, soaring without constant wingbeats.   A soaring raptor is not a requisite for a true power spot, but it  certainly adds to the effect.  The other five  hawks we have seen today were accipiters, Sharp-shinned and Cooper's, passing  quickly as accipiters are wont to do, flap, flap, glide . . . flap, flap,  glide, undulating, tumbling across the void, on a mission, hurtling southward  with great haste. This  Red-tail classic, though, is hunting or playing, perhaps a local who just happens  to be riding the currents along the east face of Aztec's overlook.  There is no sound but the soughing of the  wind through the pines behind us, we are at almost 7700 feet with a 220 degree  view to the east and southeast, and directly below, way below, is the deep gash  that Cherry Creek has cut into the Sierra Ancha range.  From this flank of Aztec we are overlooking  the Sierra Ancha Wilderness Area and, farther off, the awesome canyons of the Salt River itself.   Yes, Aztec Peak qualifies as a power spot and, probably because  we have never been here before, I now declare it unarguably my favorite Arizona power spot. Scrambling  over the lip along rock ledges that lead downward to a small shelf among trees  stunted from the thin soil and constant winds, I discover someone before me has  found it special too.  Tucked beneath a  small oak growing up from a wall of rock is a tiny cairn.  Atop the cairn is a cross with a photo and a  poem, laminated against the harsh elements of this high, isolated peak, and flowers  that appear recently fresh.  This too is  not a requisite for a true power spot, but this too certainly adds to the  effect. Though  the morning sun is directly on my back and the wind is not a cold one, I shiver  involuntarily and glance around.  The hawk  has moved on, but two passing ravens speak to one another and a chipmunk  scurries into a crevice. There are no human eyes upon me.  There may or may not be ashes beneath the  cairn.  Careful not to disturb the  memorial in any way, I crawl beneath the oak and read the poem.  It is someone's father . . . or son or  brother.  It would appear whoever brought  the flowers does so periodically.  Was it  his power spot, or is it theirs?  My wife  and I have had this debate.  Assuming  each has a different favorite, do the ashes belong at the deceased's power spot  or at that of the loved one left behind?   Our resolution to this conundrum is to leave some at both. Somewhere  on the mountain above me a Steller's Jay is chattering, and a flock of Western  Bluebirds passes overhead.  My reverie  broken, I scramble back to the top of the overlook and walk toward our  campsite, my thoughts now caught up in the breaking details of the so-called  "sweat lodge" deaths here in Arizona.  They occurred at a personal improvement  retreat near the spectacular red rocks resort/retirement community of  Sedona.  Years ago I spent a birthday at  a power spot above Oak Creek  near Sedona.  I recall a flock of Cedar  Waxwings coming to a bush there, laden with ripening berries.  Perhaps birds are a requisite for power  spots.  Or certainly their being at one  enhances the chances of recalling it. But  would it be a power spot if you paid $9685 to be there with a "personal  improvement" guru and a couple dozen other people for a "Spiritual  Warrior" event, the finale involving all participants, fasting, crammed  into pitch dark sweat lodge listening to guru's motivational aphorisms while  being encouraged not to leave no matter how many around you began feeling  faint, nauseous, or short of breath.   "Connecting with a higher power" this guru called it, and  three of his participants surely did make that connection.  They died.   Can you say "law suit?" There  is now a whole industry built up around this type of "spiritual  tourism," and a professor at Arizona   State University  who does research on the surging popularity of personal improvement events like  this, asked about the sweat lodge deaths, is quoted as saying "There's a  tendency to go to places that have a Mother Earth power."  It all sounds good, something akin to  visiting a power spot, but those two words, "power spot," do not come  to mind in regard to this incident.   "Greed," "arrogance," and "stupidity" do,  and if you need two words try "personality cult."  Perhaps spiritual warriors just need to go  birding.  By themselves.  In solitude.   In high, lonesome places. There's  probably a reason great cathedrals have vaulted ceilings, stained glass  windows, and attendees speak in hushed tones.   Aztec Peak in its autumn splendor would seem  to qualify for cathedral designation.  Hawk watch sites are natural cathedrals,  cathedrals without the human "artifice," a word carrying that  secondary connotation which drives many away from organized religion. If you  should find yourself in need of spiritual refreshment next early October and  you'd like to combine spiritual tourism, a trip to a power spot, with a little  birding, try one of these sites--Miller or Carr Peak or Montezuma Pass in the  Huachucas, Kitt Peak in the Baboquivaris, Pinal Peak south of Globe, or any number  of isolated points on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Leave your checkbook at home, take your  bible-- The Sibley Guide To Birds, and  binoculars, and pray for raptors.  Even  if no hawks are about, you'll be better for the time spent by yourself in the  solitude of Arizona's  awe inspiring high country.  Power spots,  like the birds which often frequent them, bring refreshment to the soul. jimburnsphotos.com

Can I Remotely Power Cycle My Dedicated Server? Do you Offer a Server Monitoring Service To Alert Me to Server Problems? Can I Have Dedicated Servers in Each Facility? What Backup Services are Included with My VPS or Dedicated Server? Can I Buy Additional Backup Space for my Dedicated Server? How Does Your Offsite Backup Service Work? What is the Difference Between the Standard and Geo-Redundant Backups? Which Should I Choose? How is the filesystem fault tolerant? What Security Measures do you Employ? Is My Traffic Encrypted? Do You Offer an Encrypted Filesystem? What transfer protocols do you support? Can I use (ftp/FUSE/sshfs/WinSCP/etc.)? Do you support subversion and remote repositories? Do you support postgres and MySQL databases? How will my JohnCompanies filesystem integrate into my existing backups? Is there a file size limit? Do you have multi-user access? What remote commands may I run over SSH / putty? Will the Off Site Backup integrate into all versions of Microsoft Windows? Can I back up multiple Windows systems to a single account? Can I back up my Exchange Server and SQL Server to my account? How does the JohnCompanies filesystem integrate into a Mac OSX system? What other tools can I use on my Mac OSX system with our Service? Can I back up multiple Mac OSX systems to a single account? Will an JohnCompanies filesystem preserve OSX metadata? Do you Offer DNS Services? Yes we offer primary/secondary/slaving DNS service in support of your JohnCompanies server.  Simply provide the DNS information and we take it from there. Can I Get Additional IP Addresses? Additional IP addresses are available for $1 per address per month.  An assignment of more than 8 IPs will require written justification to satisfy ARIN rules for IP address allocation. What about IPv6 Capability? As of now we have enough IPv4 addresses for the next 24 to 30 months of growth.  However that is not to say that we are not planning to implement an IPv6 capability as soon as practical.    Our IP network provider has received an IPv6 allocation from ARIN and we are in the process of verifying that each backbone provider can support IPv6. We will be developing a test network for dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 operation and expect to offer IPv6 implementation using a dual-stack approach in 2012. Why do your Servers Have RAID Arrays? Even though drive reliability is improving, hard drives (since they have moving parts) are still the most likely component to fail in your server.  Typically the failure is not a total drive failure but a problem with a particular sector that results in a server crash.  The hard drive can be reconfigured to avoid that sector but in the meantime your server is down and data is lost.  At JohnCompanies (unless you otherwise request a different option) we provision all dedicated and VPS servers with a hardware RAID controller card and mirrored hard drives so that failure of one hard drive will not cause a server crash or loss of data.  This means your server stays up and you stay on line. Does RAID Protect Against all Hard Drive Problems? As discussed above, a mirrored RAID hard drive configuration will protect you from a single hard drive failure; however, the mirrored configuration will NOT protect you from data corruption or software upgrade issues that affect both drives.  In these cases, you will need to restore from backup files. How Many Data Centers Do You Have? We operate 2 physically separate datacenters in Southern California.  Each datacenter has physical security, backup power, fire suppression systems and multiple backbone network connections. Are Your Data Centers SAS 70 Type II Audited? Yes both of our datacenters have been successfully SAS Type II audited.  SAS 70 is a Service Organization audit standard that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that certain risks will be mitigated or detected in a timely manner.  A Type I audit includes the auditor's opinion on the fairness of the service organization's description of controls that had been placed in operation and the suitability of the design of the controls to achieve the specified control objectives. A Type II audit includes the information contained in a Type I audit report plus the auditor's opinion on whether the specific controls were operating effectively during a 6-month audit period.  Type II audits are performed periodically on an on-going basis. How Do You Secure Your facilities? Our physical facilities are manned 24 hours per day 7 days per week. Biometric access controls are employed as well as video recording and strict entry/access logs. Are There Limits to Connect Speed? Our higher level network switches (and as an upgrade option for certain types of dedicated servers) are set up to connect at 1gbps to our facility routers.  All standard servers operate at a connect speed of 100mbps. How Is Bandwidth Usage Measured? We measure bandwidth usage (traffic) monthly by counting the total number of bytes in plus total bytes out.  We do not limit the connect speed of your server and we size network capacity so that each server can connect at very high burst speeds when needed to maintain network performance. What Happens If I Go Over my Bandwidth Limit? When you signup for your server we ask whether you want us to limit traffic to the server once the bandwidth limit is reached or whether you want to continue and pay up to a certain maximum for overage fees.  However less than 0.5% of our customers ever exceed their bandwidth limit and in most of those cases the excess bandwidth usage is within a few percent of their limit and we waive overage fees. How Do I know How Much Bandwidth I am Using? .  Bandwidth usage is displayed for the current month but you can search and display bandwidth usage from previous periods of time to look for trends or determine if there is unusual activity. Do You Have a Firewall for VPS Servers? Yes we do provide a firewall for VPSs.  You may of course setup your own firewall using IPTABLES rules, or alternately (or in addition to your own firewall) you may craft as many ipfw rules pertaining to your IP address as you need and provide them to us.   These rules will then be placed onto our firewall at the border of our network. Can I Scale/Upgrade My VPS? Yes you can scale your VPS at any time by moving to the next level server package.  Typically this can be done without a reboot but occasionally due to disk space constraints you may have a brief downtime to allow us to migrate your server to a new host.  You may also request additional memory, disk space or bandwidth at any time and we will accommodate your request in short order. How Does Backup Work for a VPS? When you are set up, please send us a list of all files and directories on your system that you would like us to automatically back up for you.  We do not backup anything by default, and we do not backup the entire system - only what you tell us to.  This will be backed up in full nightly. How Many Domains Can I Host on My VPS? You may host as many domains as you like on your VPS or dedicated server. Is there a Control Panel for a VPS? There is a Virtuozzo control panel for all Linux VPSs. This control panel allows you to reboot your system, stop/start your system (or services running on it), browse your filesystem, monitor resource use and open an SSH connection to your server among other things.  A FreeBSD VPS uses our which provides bandwidth use and information about your account.  Each Linux VPS also has an option to use Plesk for your system. Can I Have Remote KVM Access to My Dedicated Server When Needed? For those dedicated servers without a hardware management card, we can provide temporary remote KVM access to your server for trouble shooting or installing new software.  Just send an email with your request to Is there a Control Panel for Dedicated Servers? provides a means to look at bandwidth use and for most dedicated servers perform a hard power reset.  If you want a commercial control panel you may install it yourself or ask us to install. For RAID array monitoring we provide a script that you can install on the server that will advise you of RAID issues should they arise. Can I Remotely Power Cycle My Dedicated Server? .  If your server does not include the remote power recycle feature, you may request a power cycle any time by sending and email to our support mailbox and specify "Reboot" in the subject. Do you Offer a Server Monitoring Service To Alert Me to Server Problems? We offer a "ping" or "ssh" availability type monitoring service that will send you a text or email message if the server is non-responsive.  Simply request this service at signup or at any time with an email to our support team. Can I Have Dedicated Servers in Each Facility? Yes you can split your severs between facilities for redundancy or protection against facility outages.  The only downside is that the traffic between facilities will be counted as bandwidth usage whereas colocated servers on our internal network do not incur bandwidth penalties for peer traffic. What Backup Services are Included with My VPS or Dedicated Server? We perform backups nightly on all VPS plans for those files/directories that you specify for us.  Once setup, we automatically save the most recent backups for you, up to 7 days worth of data.  Our dedicated servers include backup space on our local backup servers.  The amount of backup space varies by server plan and you set up the backups as you require.  We will provide a script that you can install to perform the backups on a schedule and for files that you set up.   Backups do NOT count against your bandwidth allocation. Can I Buy Additional Backup Space for my Dedicated Server? Yes you can add dedicated server backup space any time for $0.15/GB per month. How Does Your Offsite Backup Service Work? Our Offsite Backup service is offered and provided independently of our dedicated and VPS server plans.  You can use this service for any server, desktop or other device you want to backup – Windows, Apple or Unix.   If you have a server with JohnCompanies, the Offsite Backup is offered at a 10% discount and you can use it for any server or desktop you want. What is the Difference Between the Standard and Geo-Redundant Backups? Both products are identical in terms of your usage and interaction. The geo-redundant accounts are distinguished in that every night, automatically, their contents are replicated to one of our other sites around the world. No action is needed on your part, and no additional integration or maintenance is necessary - we are solely responsible for this secondary replication. Which Should I Choose? If you are backing up data that you are retaining yourself, at your own location, then a standard offsite filesystem is probably sufficient. JohnCompanies then becomes your backup, and the data exists at all times in two locations (your location, and your JohnCompanies filesystem). However, if you do not maintain a copy of your data yourself, that is, if your JohnCompanies filesystem is the ONLY location that your data is stored, we suggest you purchase the geo-redundant product. Remember - if you maintain a copy, your JohnCompanies filesystem is your backup. If you do not maintain a copy, and you do not use the geo-redundant product, your data is NOT backed up. It exists in one location only (granted, a very secure and well maintained location, but still just one). How is the filesystem fault tolerant? RAID-6 protection. DO NOT trust your data to anyone running software raid, or anyone using RAID-5 (even if they utilize hot spares, etc.) All power is conditioned and backed by battery banks which are backed by diesel generators. Physical machines are connected to at least two distinct power circuits. What Security Measures do you Employ? We employ network Intrusion Detection Systems as well as IDS on each individual host. Each user’s individual filesystem is in a chroot that isolates it from the rest of the system. Finally, user filesystems all live on data partitions that are mounted noexec / nosuid / nodev which provides an additional level of safety against sophisticated attacks. Is My Traffic Encrypted? Yes. Although JohnCompanies supports the ftp and http (WebDAV) protocols (for legacy and embedded applications) we do not recommend them. Our standard network protocols are SSH and HTTPS (webDAVs), both of which are encrypted with the same level of security that is required for online banking and credit card processing. Do You Offer an Encrypted Filesystem? Yes. We support several offsite encrypted filesytems for Windows, Mac OSX and Unix. These encrypted filesystems are fully documented, and we provide full installation and integration support for them. Note that by default, the files in your filesystem are NOT encrypted, even if they are transferred over an encrypted link. What transfer protocols do you support? We support plain old FTP and HTTP (WebDAV). We support the following applications over ssh: rsync, sftp, scp, unison, rdiff-backup, rdist, duplicity. We support HTTPS (WebDAVs). Can I use (ftp/FUSE/sshfs/WinSCP/etc.)? Yes. We have opened our systems to the open-standards based protocols of FTP, SSH and WebDAV. Anything that operates properly over those channels is not only workable, but is encouraged and supported. We have tested sshfs, ftpfs, WinSCP, gftp, etc., and they behave as expected. We encourage our users to develop whatever applications or programs they would like that take advantage of our systems and the open standards they employ. Do you support subversion and remote repositories? Yes. The svnserve command is available for you to run, remotely, over SSH. This means that you can upload a repository with rsync or sftp and then access it remotely with any tool that supports the svn+ssh:// URL format. Do you support postgres and MySQL databases? Yes. Because we allow the remote execution of the 'dd' command, over SSH, you can run database dumps across an encrypted channel to a dump file in your JohnCompanies filesystem: pg_dump -U postgres db | ssh 1234@usw-s001.johncompanies.com "dd of=db_dump" mysqldump -u mysql db | ssh 1234@usw-s001.johncompanies.com "dd of=db_dump" Because you are using your own dump program, you need not worry about version incompatibilities between your client and our server. How will my JohnCompanies filesystem integrate into my existing backups? Quite easily, in fact. Regardless of whether you use an enterprise backup system in a corporate setting, or a simple consumer application at home, it will be extremely simple to integrate your JohnCompanies offsite filesystem. Our open systems allow a seamless integration into the operating system of your choice, allowing you to target your JohnCompanies filesystem as a drive letter, as a mount point, as a URL ... as anything you'd like. Further, we are intimately familiar with backup procedures and applications and will provide full support for whatever integration you require, including helping you write scripts and procedures. Is there a file size limit? No. Do you have multi-user access? Yes. You may configure additional users, at no cost, that can log in and share your account. You may control access and file permissions with standard Unix tools like 'chmod' and 'chgrp'. OR, you may simply describe to us the permissions and access scheme you would like, and we will implement it for you. If you are an existing customer, simply email and request one or more "sub accounts" - we will provide them for you immediately. What remote commands may I run over SSH / putty? You may run the checksum commands md5, sha1, sha256 and rmd160. You may run rsync, unison, rdiff-backup and rdist. Other remote commands include: dd, cp (GNU), ls, mkdir, pwd, chmod, chgrp, ln, mv, rm, rmdir, touch, tail, groups, id, passwd and quota. Will the Off Site Backup integrate into all versions of Microsoft Windows? Yes. A JohnCompanies offsite backup account, and the associated client programs, will run on any version of Microsoft Windows - including Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows 7. Can I back up multiple Windows systems to a single account? Yes. You can set up backups on one or more systems, all of which can store them in a single account. Most of the time a network of multiple Windows systems is first backed up, locally, to a central server (perhaps a file server or your Primary Domain Controller, etc.) then our Backup Agent is run on just that single computer, backing up all of the data in one transaction. You can, of course, simply install our Backup Agent on all of your systems and have them individually backup their data - all to the same account. Or you can have some combination of clients and servers. It is completely up to you, and we are happy to help you implement a strategy that fits your needs. Can I back up my Exchange Server and SQL Server to my account? Yes. Our Backup Agent automatically detects open files and uses the builtin Windows snapshot functionality to safely back those files up. How does the JohnCompanies filesystem integrate into a Mac OSX system? Integration for OSX systems is extremely fast and simple because OSX is built on an underlying Unix system. Therefore, implementation is as simple as adding a few rsync lines to your crontab or launchd. There is no need to install any software or make any configuration changes. Setting up powerful, efficient backups on your OSX system is literally a five-minute operation. As for browsing and interacting with those backups once they are on our end, you can simply browse the offsite filesystem from the Finder, and interact with your offsite data just like you would on any local hard drive. What other tools can I use on my Mac OSX system with our Service? Interarchy, Fetch, Fugu, RsyncX, Goliath ... there are literally thousands of FTP, SFTP and rsync clients for a Mac OSX system, not to mention the standard unix tools scp, sftp, rsync, etc., that come pre-installed in the Unix subsystem. Can I back up multiple Mac OSX systems to a single account? Yes. You can set up backups on one or more systems, all of which can store them in a single account. Most of the time a network of multiple Mac OSX systems is first backed up, locally, to a central server (perhaps a file server or departmental server) then rsync jobs are run from that central file server, backing up all of the data in one transaction. You can, of course, simply run rsync jobs from each individual workstation. Or you can have some combination of clients and servers. It is completely up to you, and we are happy to help you implement a strategy that fits your needs. Will an JohnCompanies filesystem preserve OSX metadata? Yes. The unison backup tool (free, open source) preserves all OSX filesystem metadata and is a backup protocol that we fully support. Facilities / Network
2009: | | | | | | | Read Jonny's  Baseball World Cup blog HERE An Interview with new IBAF President Riccardo Fraccarii: On Sunday in Lausanne, Switzerland, Riccardo Fraccari, President of the Italian Baseball Federation, was elected the 16th president of the International Baseball Federation, the global governing body for the sport of baseball. President Fraccari is the second Italian to assume the IBAF presidency, following the late Aldo Notari, who was IBAF President from 1993-2007. He will begin his four-year term today. President Fraccari is one of the key people responsible for baseball’s growth in Europe. His initial work in baseball came as an umpire, learning the game and organizing local, regional and national events for over 30 years. He was eventually voted Italy’s top professional umpire and the top amateur umpire in the world and was inducted into the ABUA Hall of Fame in 2002. As a baseball officer President Fraccari served as vice president of FIBS under President Notari from 1985 to 2000 and as an umpire commissioner in Italy for over 20 years. The Pisa, Italy, native was also president of the European Confederation Technical Commission and a member of the International Federation Technical Commission. Italian Baseball has seen its biggest growth period internationally during Fraccari’s run as president, with a growing professional league and increased play for both able bodied and disabled children. He was also a key organizer of the recently completed World Cup, which was played across Europe in September and ended with the United States defeating Cuba for the second consecutive time, this time before a sellout crowd in Nettuno, Italy. We took a few minutes to conduct a brief Q&A with the new president: BBD: What are the first things you would like to accomplish in office? RF: We need to reinvent the structure of our Lausanne office, be more transparent and involve our member federations more on a day-to-day basis. As an international federation we need to be more efficient and professional. I will first learn what the current situation of the office is and will make necessary changes from there. BBD: What are your feelings on the Olympics? RF: We need to deeply analyze where we are on the Olympic landscape. We cannot afford to invest money on a campaign to return to the Olympic Programme at this point. What we need to do is to continue to strengthen our sport and federation, which will help prove to the IOC that it needs baseball back. BBD: There has been a lot of talk with regard to funding. Without government support, where do you think the best possible IBAF revenue streams will come from? RF: It is critical that we quickly develop new streams of income for the federation. We need the help of professional leagues and in general we need to make our product more attractive and valuable to investors, donors and sponsors. We may need to transform our tournaments, for example, as well as introduce new events, like a World Championship featuring club teams from around the world. BBD: What do you think the relationship will be with the professional leagues? RF: This is easy to answer â€“ it is extremely important for us to strengthen our relationship with the world’s professional leagues. To this point, I am planning on offering representatives from some of the top professional leagues a position on our newly-formed Executive Committee. They need us to help continue to develop players worldwide, and we certainly need their support both on and off the field. BBD: There has been a good deal of talk with regard to developing women’s baseball. Will you continue that growth and will you try and re-open talks with softball about working together? RF: We will definitely continue to support women’s baseball, from the grassroots level to the Women’s Baseball World Cup. We will also try to convince softball that our only chance to the return to the Olympic Programme is through a combined bid. We need to illustrate to softball’s leaders that it was a mistake for them to call for their member federations to split with baseball. BBD: Where do you think the biggest growth areas for baseball are? RF: As evidenced by our bringing the 2009 Baseball World Cup to Europe we believe that the continent is certainly an area with room for significant growth. Looking at Europe’s market, economy and number of interested players, we believe that the opportunity is there.. Africa is another area where we think baseball has a bright future, and we look forward to exploring that and assisting with its efforts. BBD: What do you think the biggest challenges are? RF: The biggest challenge, again, is changing the identity of the federation. We need to restructure, cut expenses and grow our income through a strengthened relationship with the world’s professional leagues. We also look forward to continuing the ongoing challenge of growing the game of baseball around the world and helping educate players on our sport at a young age and on a grassroots level Riccardo Fraccari of Italy Elected New President of IBAF: (LAUSANNE, Switzerland) - Riccardo Fraccari of Italy was elected President of the International Baseball Federation (IBAF) on Sunday to conclude the Federation’s weekend-long continental meetings and Congress. Fraccari replaces outgoing President Dr. Harvey W. Schiller who has led the IBAF since taking over mid-term in 2007 for the late Aldo Notari. In thanking the member federations for their support, Fraccari immediately addressed the tasks at hand for the IBAF. “I want the IBAF to truly be the home of international baseball", said Fraccari. “It is at this point that we need to shape our future - we need to take care of the development of baseball all over the world. This is the only way to truly become a global sport.” Fraccari was unopposed in his bid for IBAF President and therefore automatically won the election. The recently re-elected 1st Vice President of the European Baseball Confederation (CEB), Fraccari also served as Continental Vice President (Europe) of the IBAF under Schiller. He said that building upon the IBAF’s relationship with the world’s top professional leagues is among the most important things he will look to accomplish in his new role. “It is extremely important for us to strengthen our relationship with the world’s professional leagues,” said Fraccari. “They need us to help continue to develop players worldwide, and we certainly need their support both on and off the field.” Fraccari served as Vice President of Federazione Italiana Baseball Softball (FIBS) under President Notari from 1985 to 2000 and as an Umpire Commissioner in Italy. He was President of the CEB Technical Commission and a member of the IBAF Technical Commission. He was elected President of the Italian Federation on 8 Dec. 2001 and was recently voted into his third term. New members of the IBAF’s Executive Committee were also elected on Sunday. Among them are Paul Seiler of the United States and Tony Castro - son of Fidel Castro - of Cuba. The 14-person group will be tasked with helping the federation’s membership continue the growth of international baseball from the grassroots level to the sport’s premiere world championships â€“ the World Baseball Classic and the IBAF Baseball World Cup. Fraccari and the Executive Committee will begin a four-year term on Monday. The elected Executive Committee is as follows: President - Riccardo Fraccari, ITA 1st Vice President - Kazuhiro Tawa, JPN 2nd Vice President - Alonso Perez Gonzalez, MEX 3rd Vice President - Tony Castro, CUB Secretary General - Israel Roldan, PUR Treasurer - Rene Laforce, BEL 1st Member at Large - Paul Seiler, USA 2nd Member at Large - Tom Peng, TPE 3rd Member at Large - Luis Melero, ESP These members are in addition to the IBAF’s Continental Vice Presidents (Presidents of continental federations), each of whom sit on the federation’s Executive Committee as well. These members include: Africa - Ishola Williams, NGR; Americas - Eduardo De Bello, PAN; Asia - Seung-Kyoo Kang, KOR; Europe - Martin Miller, GER; and Oceania - John Ostermeyer, AUS. Over the last two years Dr. Schiller spearheaded the IBAF’s bid to return to the Olympic Programme in 2016 and oversaw a baseball competition at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games that witnessed record crowds and spurred interest in the sport throughout the country. Dr. Schiller’s time with the IBAF was also highlighted by the introduction of Baseball World Rankings for both men and women, the birth of an International Women’s Baseball Committee and the first-ever Women’s Continental Championship in Venezuela, an improved online presence with the introduction of IBAF.org, the IBAF becoming fully WADA-compliant, numerous new baseball federations worldwide, and most recently, the first ever IBAF Baseball World Cup to be held in multiple countries throughout Europe (seven countries in total) which featured the most competing nations (22) in the tournament’s history as well. “I have thoroughly enjoyed my two years as President and leave the position knowing that the best years are yet to come for baseball, and I look forward as a fan and supporter to assisting in any way possible” said Schiller addressing the Congress. “Personally I want to thank all of you whom I have come in contact with for all your help and good wishes. Baseball is the ultimate team game, and we would not be successful in our efforts at any level if our whole team was not working toward one goal - growing the game.” Also announced at the Congress was the naming of the federation’s top Senior Athlete, Junior Athlete, Coach, Umpire and Member Federation Executive. The awards had been presented on an annual basis until 2004 and have not been awarded since. The 2009 awards recognize achievements over the last two years, which is a period of time that allows the federation to consider athletes from at least one of its two professional events - the Baseball World Cup and World Baseball Classic, both of which are competed in every-four-years cycles - and both of its junior events - the 18U World Junior Championships and the 16U World Youth Championships, which are competed in alternating every-other-year cycle. The recipients of the awards and a brief summary of their achievements are as follows: Senior Athlete - Justin Smoak (Triple-A Oklahoma City, MILB) Junior Athlete - Yung-Hoon Sung (Doosan Bears, KBO) Coach - Tatsunori Hara (Yomiuri Giants, NPB) Umpire - Paul Hyham ( Australia) Member Federation Executive  - Juergen Elsishans (German Federation) “The IBAF congratulates each of our award winners and the member federations which they represent” said Schiller. “International baseball has witnessed extraordinary achievements over the past two years, and we look forward to future success stories in the years to come” Q&A with outgoing IBAF President Dr. Harvey Schiller: Q: You have had a two-year run as IBAF President. How would you describe your experience? A: I think it was terrific and rewarding. I had been out of the international sports community for a while and was glad to be able to use my contacts to help grow the game and bring new partners into the sport. The progress we made to unify various entities within the sport, the progress we made with anti-doping initiatives, the Beijing Olympics, the World Baseball Classic and the Baseball World Cup were all very gratifying. It was also very impressive to see the passion that so many around the world have for the sport, whether it is at the federation or volunteer level or at the highest professional level. It is truly a global game and a sport for all. The biggest disappointment was the Olympic re-instatement bid, but even in that process I think we learned a great deal about how to grow the sport even without the Olympics. The Olympics may not want baseball, but baseball will always embody the Olympic ideal. Q: Why did you choose not to run again? A: I felt it is time to do something different. We made a great deal of progress in two very short years and I would like to stay involved, but the time commitment was pulling me away from other duties. Many people don’t realize it is a volunteer position with fulltime hours. I don’t regret a minute, but it is time to move on and help in other ways than as president. Q: Is there anything you would have done differently? A: I think with regard to the Olympics the approach we took was the right one. We did not waste money on consultants as other sports did, we spent money and time to grow the game and build awareness. I think the fact the President Rogge took the voting out of the hands of the delegates and into the hands of the Executive Committee changed everything, so perhaps making a longer and stronger push amongst the delegates to get the process changed would have helped, but all indications are the die was cast. The co-operation of MLB and the Player’s Association with regard to top players was outstanding. They paid all costs and as a result almost no money from IBAF was used for the President’s office or expenses or the Olympic programme. Q: Do you think the governance of the sport today is in a better shape than it was when you came on board? A: I do think so yes. The relationships with all the various governing entities in the sport, from MLB and the Japanese League to Little League and the Federations, are vastly improved and that is a tribute to our staff. I also believe the whole Olympic process gave baseball the opportunity to create healthy dialogue with many countries where the sport is now growing, and that sets the table for a brighter future. Q: One of the biggest issues remains steroids. How do you think baseball is addressing the issue? A: I do not think baseball, whether it is the IBAF or MLB or the Player’s Union, gets enough credit for the leadership position the sport has taken with regard to anti-doping. Baseball has more in competition tests than any sport, has had very few positive tests of any kind in international competition, and is working very hard to continue to police itself. We are fully WADA compliant, and the fact that players do get caught is a sign that the system is working. The sport is as clean today as it has ever been and is cleaner than most if not all other sports. I think in time the facts will show that the steps baseball has taken will be landmark, and will set the standard for all international sports going forward. Q: Do you think the failure to return baseball to the Olympics was an anti-American statement by the IOC? A: I think if that is true it is very shortsighted, given the fact that baseball is the national pastime of many countries outside of the United States, and is now the largest sport in the world not on the Olympic programme. Our plan effectively addressed all the issues that were presented to us as to why baseball was removed from the Olympic programme, and as a result the game is stronger not just in the United States, but in places where is it now just taking hold. We are probably a victim of our own success more than anything. The IOC felt they wanted two new sports for the programme in rugby sevens and golf, and that’s what they pushed through to the membership. Q: Should baseball try again for 2020? A: My recommendation is no. If the Olympic movement wanted baseball it would have brought the sport back for 2016. The cost associated with pushing for re-instatement again pulls monies away from developing the game, and in a challenged economy that is not a smart thing to do. We should continue to grow our international events and find new business partners, and if the Olympic movement would like us back we will be open to that. However pursuing the Olympics again I believe is a waste. The ultimate decision however will be up to the new board and the new president. Q: What are the biggest challenges the new president will face? A: I think finding funding in those countries whose federations are run by government monies tied to the Olympics will be the biggest challenge. Baseball in established countries will continue to grow, the biggest challenge will be helping those smaller countries where the sport is just taking root to get the funds necessary to grow grassroots programs. The relationships with the Major Leagues also has to continue to develop and stay positive. Many forget that the World Baseball Classic contributed $15 million (USD) to the IBAF and its federations for development of the game, and MLB completely funded our Olympic effort as well. That relationship has to stay healthy, and we need to continue to move forward with relationships with the professional leagues in Japan, Korea and Chinese Taipei as well. Q: What are the biggest opportunities the new president will have? A: One of the biggest surprises for me in the last few months was the interest at the grassroots level for women’s and girls baseball. There are thousands of young women who play the game and then switch to softball or other sports in their teens because of lack of opportunity. That I think is a big growth area. I also think that the professionals now see that representing their country is much more important to them than they ever thought possible, so growing a top tier international event like the WBC is very important for the development of the game. Q: Do you think baseball at the professional level and at the grassroots level can work effectively together? A: Yes and I think we have proved that the relationship between the two, which some people saw as mutually exclusive, is very beneficial to all. If you look at other sports - basketball for example, and see how the NBA works with all the grassroots organizations around the world to grow the game - you see a healthy working relationship. That is what we have started with baseball and should continue. The IBAF can be a very strong conduit for the professional leagues to grow the game in emerging countries, and that grows MLB’s fan base. Our efforts have provided grassroots support around the globe, and have included the help of local and federal governments, organizations like Ripken Baseball, and many former players who are now more involved with the growth of the game than ever before. All very positive to show how one side benefits the other Q: Will you stay involved in baseball? A: I have told everyone I would like to help in any way. This past summer I was asked to join the board of the Baseball Hall of Fame, so that will also keep me involved as well on some level. I admit I was a fan of baseball before this process, but now I really see the value of the game at all levels as a social unifier and a game for all, and it was very frustrating to me that the IOC did not see that value that so many others see. Therefore anything I can do to help grow that global presence I will do. Q: What do you see for the future of baseball? A: I think it is very bright. The growth in emerging nations and across Europe at the grassroots level has to be cultivated, as that will build a new fanbase. The partnership with MLB and the NPB has to continue to evolve, and the ability to be a unifier for all the groups involved in the game, from the manufacturers to the various bodies that run the sport at every level from Teeball on up, has to continue. In one of the worst economic years on record, baseball grew in exposure and stayed on par with revenue, and that says a great deal about where the sport sits on a global basis. We must continue to tell the story of baseball to its ardent fans and its recent and potential converts, and if we continue to do that the game will grow around the world 2011: 2010: | | | 2009: | | | | | | | www.fireball.co.uk

When I asked him whether he was a dealer, he said that he is, but knowing that I was down for the count printer-wise and desperate to get back online, he encouraged me to consider buying the printer from another source, if I could get it sooner than he could provide it. Talk about honest! technicians for thermal label printers, line printers, dot-matrix printers, laser printers and HP DesignJet plotters. Professor Lidia Morawska from QUT's International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health lead the study to answer questions raised by earlier findings that almost one third of popular laser printers emitted large numbers of ultrafine particles. Our website provides product warranty information and you can also check warranty status on your printer. If this went well, the computer and the plotter are now in sync and we can try catting a test file to the serial port.

Agave Nectar has the following characteristics: Because Agave Nectar is high in fructose, it enjoys all the benefits which continue to make fructose a preferred sweetening agent. It is sweeter than refined sugar (approximately 1.4 times sweeter); in fact, fructose offers an equivalent sweetness for nearly half the amount of carbohydrate calories. Fructose does not stimulate digestive insulin secretion as do other sugars. It is less disturbing to the glycemic index. In common parlance, it does not create a "sugar rush." Agave Nectar is produced in different grades varying in flavor and color. The lighter grades of Agave Nectar are flavor neutral, enhancing the natural flavors of coffee, tea, fruit beverages, baked goods, fresh fruits, fruit smoothies, salad dressings, jams and jellies, ice cream, yoghurts, and various prepared foods, without altering their flavor. This is in marked contrast with bee honey, malt barley syrup, and certain other natural sugar substitutes that do alter the flavor of the products which they sweeten. The amber and dark grades offer the delicate flavor of Agave with increasing intensity. The amber grade is much like honey and delicious in tea, suitable to sweeten a wide variety of foods, dry and hot cereals, pancakes, waffles, baked goods, protein drinks, and sauces. Heavier sauces such as BBQ, spaghetti, stews and meat glazes may be enhanced by the darker grades of this sweetener which deliver the rich and complex flavors distinctive to Agave. Agave Nectar will not crystallize. It is high in purity and stable in composition. It is easy to store as it has a very long shelf life, approximately three years. Agave Nectar is easy to handle. Because of its light viscosity, Agave Nectar is easy to handle in an industrial setting and pours easily as a table-top sweetener. It will never harden in the bottle. Agave Nectar is highly soluble and dissolves readily even in cold beverages such as lemonade or iced teas. Its light viscosity and solubility also make it ideal to sweeten cold cereals. Agave Nectar is a moisture retainer. It increases the water retention properties of food. In bread and baked goods, Agave Nectar enhances product freshness due to its hygroscopic properties which act as humidifying agents, thereby increasing the shelf life of such products. Agave Nectar is certified organic. The manufacturers have obtained organic certification from BCS Oeko Garantie Gmbh, a German firm accredited by the USDA. The Agave crops used in producing Agave Nectar are herbicide and pesticide free. Growers that supply the raw material will use only natural fertilizers and employ agricultural practices that meet organic certification standards. The manufacturers will also obtain organic certification on their manufacturing process. Agave Nectar is KOSHER. The manufacturers have obtained KOSHER PAREVE certification: Special Kosher – Lepesach production certification for their plant. Total Carbohydrate Grams: Serving Size: This product falls into the "honey" category, and thus its serving size is 1 tablespoon (note: tablespoon and not teaspoon). In turn, 1 tablespoon of Agave Nectar weighs 21 grams. Based on the fact that it contains on the average 77% solids, one serving (1 tablespoon) contains 16 grams total carbohydrates (21 grams x 77% = 16 grams). Calories per Serving: A serving (1 tablespoon) contains 60 calories. (One serving contains 16 grams of total carbohydrates. One gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories. Therefore, 16 grams of total carbohydrate contains 64 calories, but a few of these calories are not digestible.) Glycemic Index: This is a relatively new concept which can be important from a metabolic standpoint, especially to diabetics, along with athletes and grossly overweight individuals. The index is an indicator as to how much your blood sugar increases in 2-3 hours after specific food consumption. Most if not all carbohydrates are normally metabolized into the simple carbohydrate glucose, which in the glycemic index concept is arbitrarily assigned a value of 100. As a result, the higher a glycemic index food number is, the faster it raises your blood sugar level. Foods or ingredients with glycemic index numbers close to or above 100 present some significant health issues to diabetics, and in general, sweeteners of all kinds should be avoided by diabetics. Nonetheless, for those diabetics who choose to consume certain amounts of carbohydrates, Agave Nectar, it should be noted has a lower glycemic index than honey. Agave Nectar was found to have a glycemic index of 32. In contrast, honey has a reported glycemic index of 58, due to its higher ratio of glucose to fructose, as compared to the ratio of glucose to fructose in Agave Nectar. Please note: these values are based on using glucose as the reference point, which is the currently accepted approach relative to reporting glycemic index. Earlier, white bread was the reference point, but white bread composition can vary widely, and thus glucose is now the preferred base product. Copyright © 2007 American Diabetes Advocates.

data-lang="en">Tweet and writing content that will be received well by search engines.  It turns out that this isn’t a problem unique to me. Journalists have been having a hard time getting copy placed into Google News because their headlines are written to draw people in rather than to be found in search.  Rand Fishkin and Joost de Valk encourage writers to make targeted keywords the first words of a headline, first words of an article and incorporated into the page URL to increase their search visibility.  While this is an effective strategy from my experience, it is oftentimes impractical to make an article appealing by doing this. I thought Google was over keywords? Google has diminished or eliminated meta keywords from inclusion in their algorithm, but recently reintroduced the news_keywords tag, to allow for writers to write compelling headlines and to inform Google about the specific topics in the metadata of the post.  From : “The goal is simple: empower news writers to express their stories freely while helping Google News to properly understand and classify that content so that it’s discoverable by our wide audience of users. Similar in spirit to the plain keywords metatag, the news_keywords metatag lets publishers specify a collection of terms that apply to a news article. These words don’t need to appear anywhere within the headline or body text.” They are quick to point out that the tag is just one component of the signal, and I suspect that there may still be preference for traditional SEO formatting, but it is a great tool to try to appease search engines while compelling readers. . So, the good folks at Topoftheburg have created a WordPress plugin that creates the news_keyword meta data for your Google News site.  One of the things that I love about WordPress is that creative people come up with helpful solutions.  And it’s free to download from their site (disclaimer: though I am unaffiliated with these folks, I also have not tried the plugin). If you are publishing news worthy material and are having a hard time balancing good copy and SEO, this might be a solution to get Google to take notice.  And if not, you can talk somewhat intelligently about the news_keyword meta tag at your next social event. leaderswest.com I'm the guy that wrote the article you just read. Sorry for the typos. Hi Jim. Have you actually implemented this yourself or know anyone else who has? I was under the impression that this would not work unless you get approved as a news source by Google first (not easy from my understanding). Thanks. Thanks Paul, I mentioned it in passing in the post and you’re totally right.  The link in the article is to the publisher page, and my understanding is that sites are vetted by an actual human being.  And the reason I published the disclaimer about the plug-in is that my content wouldn’t meet the criteria for Google News pubishing.  Great points and I appreciate you reading and commenting, Paul!

So anyway, I have now prepared this big hard work submit and googled lots of things. Be at liberty to verify your self. I wrote this because After i was performing the analysis, you would typically just encounter recipes with absolutely no rationalization. I recognize it isn't sourced - I'm anyone, that has a task and lifestyle and I've misplaced observe of the sources. Glowing skin– Some Gals have stated that their pores and skin is becoming glowing after working with this vitamin C item, generally primary them not even to placed on make-up. For Many others, this merchandise works fantastic to be a primer and moisturizer simultaneously. Alright, some clarification prior to I get on the recipe. Basically, if you would like battle the visible indications of getting older (essentially all of these) what you wish to do is increase your pores and skin's collagen production. Between the most effective topical solutions for collagen generation is Vitamin C. The big challenge is it is very unstable (degrades in a short time usually and really, very quickly when subjected to air or gentle). For this reason, beauty companies have accomplished lots of investigation into how to create Vitamin C much more secure - they've had some achievements (Though not THAT A great deal) as well as the solutions they offer with the stabilized Vitamin C are high-priced in comparison to Do-it-yourself serum. In actual fact, stabilizing Vitamin C has confirmed so tricky that normally Vitamin A (i.e. tretinoin/Retin-A) is most popular for collagen manufacturing - It can be actually not as successful as Vitamin C (no less than on acne scarring), but it's steady. For people actually thinking about this, This is certainly the data I would have liked to obtain out there. On the other hand, just like all claims in the world of pores and skin treatment, you need to analysis and validate yourself. All I'm sure is usually that Vitamin C is quite unstable and degrades immediately... it could perform nevertheless... just unsure. Ooh. And I love that it's all natural. I get so overwhelmed by each of the products and solutions at The shop. Great to possess a dependable source for strategies! :) 1st phrase of warning: For those who have rosacae with really sensitive pores and skin, don’t use the serums with 10 or twenty% vit C, they may be a little also sturdy for the sensitive pores and skin, we advocate you to definitely persist with this vit C serum alternatively (ascorbic booster serum). Lots of of you request me what I exploit daily and I assure that put up is coming soon...but a person solution that I can't Are living without having is Vitamin C serum. It tightens the skin, will help lighten hormonal pigmentation (I was one of those which was cursed with horrible pregnancy melasma) and can help thrust back wrinkles. I a vitamin C serum day by day and agree that it would make my skin astonishingly glowy and comfortable and new! But how great that I might make my own! I'm going to make this serum obviously! As often, many thanks for sharing. : ) Hello there, I would like to do that serum. I am pondering if I'm able to include the powder to my overall body mouisturizer? Remember to guidance. Many thanks never microwave or warmth in anyway. you can ruin your vitamin c. Add DISTILLED (NOT faucet) h2o, MIX, after which the glycerin. glycerin will also increase the lifetime of one's formulation but it's tough to have the crystals to dissolve in just glycerin. My pores and skin will not like glycerine as being a depart on, so I make mine with just rose water and Vitamin C powder. It can be much more like a toner this way rather than a serum, but it really works beautifully for my skin. The point is to have the Vitamin C into the skin. A quite common recipe requires one/two glycerin and one/two distilled h2o for your provider, Though you can go all glycerin (such as this 1), or all distilled or rose drinking water. If you want your skin to return to the way in which it was or have a balanced glow, a topical Vitamin C serum is probably the greatest ways which you can just take. addressing the inquiries about introducing other substances, I don't have a solution for each of these but my concern is why? we're producing vitamin c serum, not a vitamin c moisturizer. Anonymous- Vitamin C has an organic brightening influence so Certainly, This could aid lighten discolored parts of the pores and skin. Vitamin C serum may possibly lead to short-term redness and that is typical, but if you have any burning sensation take away with great drinking water and lower the ratio of Vitamin C powder to vegetable glycerine. Also when making my very own vit c serum with hydraulic acid what's The easiest method to merge these two components? Q: Can it be probable this could raise wonderful lines underneath the eyes?

Work as an excellent antioxidant that also improves the security of sunscreen against harming solar rays to better secure the skin versus future problems! So many of you check with me what I take advantage of each day And that i guarantee that submit is coming quickly...but 1 solution which i can't Are living without the need of is Vitamin C serum. It tightens your skin, allows lighten hormonal pigmentation (I used to be a type of which was cursed with horrible pregnancy melasma) and can help ward off wrinkles. Why? As we age, our overall body generates less and fewer of the essential acid, affecting how humidity is stored within our skin. I use Girl Soma's Renewal Serum because it has both equally These substances in 1 serum, and its been receiving me the results I have already been looking for. I have never noticed so much confusion in only one thread ever.....It is actually quite very simple men and women, You should use L ascorbic powder, not vitamin C tablets....just one teaspoon of L ascorbic powder to two teaspoons of distilled drinking water, put in an amber bottle and apply in lieu of a toner and after that make use of your regular moisturizer. You need to insert water to this recipe, or else It really is just gonna remain gritty. I've been mixing lotions and potions my total existence, and vegetable glycerin might be my favorite, go-to component and I love the thought of the ascorbic acid powder to create a Vitamin C serum but there is no way it's going to dissolve in any way the powder. But, I started with bottled spring drinking water and held incorporating the Vitamin C powder right until the water achieved it's saturation place and wouldn't dissolve any more on the powder. Dr. Perricone endorses applying in Light patting motions beneath the eye location. Use early morning and night to accomplish optimal results and comply with by using a Perricone MD eye cream. Steer clear of connection with eyes. If Get in touch with occurs, flush quickly with h2o. It is that a lot of the products that incorporate Vitamin C never really perform because they don’t are actually effectively formulated. So what is our major 3 vit C serums? Check our greatest vitamin C serum critiques and comparison chart slightly below: It is just a prolonged-standing corporation policy that we cannot disclose The proportion of solution components, as That is proprietary facts. Since it the glycerin isn't going to appear to be the major component but basically a carrier, do you think that fractionated coconut oil will be very good? I've that 1 on hand and would love to make with what I have already got. I just produced some serum, and I forgot to grind the powder so mine was gritty too. I just set it in microwave for your couple seconds, and it wasn't so gritty! Sorry several of you are possessing trouble with obtaining the crystals to dissolve. My recommendation could well be so as to add a very small bit of distilled water (this will likely assist them dissolve somewhat) and make use of a magic bullet or blender to essentially get anything blended. Hope that can help! I discover glycerine will make the serum very sticky. I at present make use of the recipe from gorgeously inexperienced and her recipe In huge doses, some vitamins have documented aspect-outcomes that tend to be far more severe with a larger dosage. The chance of consuming a lot of of any vitamin from foods is distant, but overdosing (vitamin poisoning) from vitamin supplementation does arise. I will give my watch again listed here a unique way. Plenty of people will acquire a lot more benefits from 0-4000 IU/day of vitamin D from foods/supplements than hurt. Having said that, the dangers are very well documented. I’m satisfied to see that you just assist patients by making use of biochemical repair. It’s such a beautiful, restorative strategy! In 1910, the primary vitamin intricate was isolated by Japanese scientist Umetaro Suzuki, who succeeded in extracting a water-soluble sophisticated of micronutrients from rice bran and named it aberic acid (later Orizanin). He published this discovery in a very Japanese scientific journal.[fifty one] In the event the post was translated into German, the interpretation didn't point out that it was a recently found out nutrient, a claim designed in the first Japanese article, and hence his discovery failed to acquire publicity. In 1912 Polish-born biochemist Casimir Funk, Doing work in London, isolated exactly the same sophisticated of micronutrients and proposed the sophisticated be named "vitamine". It had been later on to become generally known as vitamin B3 (niacin), however he explained it as "anti-beri-beri-aspect" (which would these days be called thiamine or vitamin B1). 8) A bad mood. Vitamin D is understood to have psychological consequences. It really is alleged to enhance mood. I’m genuinely not comfortable with listing this for a facet result mainly because it is so subjective. Currently, Medical professionals are measuring blood amounts of vitamin D and concluding that reduced concentrations call for health supplements (rather than sunshine). Lots of of those consumers are getting the dietary supplements and staying harmed. Should you Do not believe me, go through the comment section under. Deficiency in these 5 vitamins will cause Loss of life and disability from vitamin A deficiency, beri beri, pellagra, scurvy, and rickets respectively. I’m planning to get started with vitamin D for the reason that There is certainly an urgent will need to understand vitamin D better. ) Vitamin C and other antioxidants help stop that harm. Damage to the lens of the eye, harm to molecules circulating all over inside our bloodstream, and harm to genetic substance (DNA) in our cells are all samples of destruction that were proven for being prevented beneath specific conditions by vitamin C. A single attention-grabbing software of vitamin C as an antioxidant is its means to transform iron into a point out that is best absorbed in the intestine. Together with vitamin C-loaded foods in recipes with your very best iron resources can likely be a method to improve iron absorption. As soon as progress and development are done, vitamins continue to be important nutrients for that nutritious routine maintenance in the cells, tissues, and organs that make up a multicellular organism; In addition they enable a multicellular lifetime type to efficiently use chemical Strength furnished by food stuff it eats, and that will help approach the proteins, carbohydrates, and fats required for respiration.[5] Vitamin A metabolic inhibition because of alcohol use for the duration of pregnancy may be the elucidated mechanism for fetal Alcoholic beverages syndrome and is particularly characterised by teratogenicity carefully matching maternal vitamin A deficiency.[40] So, my stage is, There's a good motive men and women are displaying up with small levels of D: They are really contaminated with stealth microorganisms. Supplementing with D is just aiding and abetting the enemy. We have to halt supplementing with D and, in its place, get rid of from the terrible stealth microorganisms. In 2005 Dr. Gominak serendipitously discovered that most of the patients in her neurology follow who consulted her about problems, seizures, back again suffering, dizziness and equilibrium issues had irregular results when she done rest studies on them. Typically they weren't even aware that their rest pattern was irregular. The AI for other everyday living stage and gender groups is thought to address the requirements of all men and women during the group, but lack of knowledge helps prevent being able to specify with self esteem The share of individuals protected by this ingestion."[17] Consequently, Just about every "vitamin" refers to several vitamer compounds that each one present the biological activity linked to a particular vitamin. This type of set of chemical compounds is grouped underneath an alphabetized vitamin "generic descriptor" title, for instance "vitamin A", which incorporates the compounds retinal, retinol, and 4 regarded carotenoids. Vitamers by definition are convertible towards the Energetic method of the vitamin in the human body, and are sometimes inter-convertible to each other, too. Welcome to our blog.

[Chameleon] PHP5 and Chameleon bartvde at xs4all.nl bartvde at xs4all.nl Wed Mar  2 09:54:29 EST 2005 Previous message: [Chameleon] PHP5 and Chameleon Next message: [Chameleon] Results from query placed on page with map Messages sorted by: [ date ] [ thread ] [ subject ] [ author ] Hi Jacob, I think the difference between php.exe and php-cgi.exe is that php.exe is supposed to be used from the command-line only. It used to be one executable, but I think they separated the two. See also install.txt:    |-php-cgi.exe          -- CGI executable    |    |-php-win.exe          -- executes scripts without an opened command    |    |-php.exe              -- CLI executable - ONLY for command line scripting I did not get any error messages with the ROI sample, the only problem I had was with the sample application finding chameleon.php. I changed my include_path in php.ini: include_path = ".;/ms4w/apps/chameleon/htdocs" And used in the phtml file: include( "chameleon.php" ); For the whole module thing I had to do the following: For PHP4 (with PHP5 this is not necessary because they changed the directory structures): copy everything from dlls and sapi to the php root directory. The following config in httpd.conf: ## ## PHP 4 Module config ## #AddType application/x-httpd-php .php4 .php3 .phtml .php #LoadModule php4_module "C:/ms4w/Apache/php/php4apache2.dll" #PHPIniDir "/ms4w/Apache/php/" ## ## PHP 5 Module config ## AddType application/x-httpd-php .php4 .php3 .phtml .php LoadModule php5_module "C:/ms4w/Apache/php5/php5apache2.dll" PHPIniDir "/ms4w/Apache/php5/" I did move some of the dll's mapscript depends on, into the system32 folder, but I don't know if this is necessary.

If the goal of CSP is to prevent post-script-execution data exfiltration, then I'm not sure how that could be attained without making some sweeping changes.

Speech is different.  Baregin is available in 95% of dialogs.  We can't expect implementations to open a new socket for every server request.  That's crazy. I share you concern about the complexity/time continuum.  But I'm not willing to push out a spec that is inherently flawed on such a major use case. If the device proposal plays out (which I definitely support), this will be a no-op.  If it doesn't, then the requirement probably boils down to 1) A request ID returned by the UA, 2) A cancel(var requestID) function. -----Original Message----- From: Bjorn Bringert [mailto: bringert@google.com ]  Sent: Tuesday, December 14, 2010 12:26 PM To: Young, Milan Cc: public-xg-htmlspeech@w3.org Subject: Re: "Protocol" requirement - Cancel request On Tue, Dec 14, 2010 at 5:30 PM, Young, Milan < Milan.Young@nuance.com > wrote: > Let's take these issues one by one: > >  * Is it possible to do this under HTTP - Yes.  All we need is to send a second request that causes the first to stop transmitting.

Earlier he threatened to leave the UN after it criticized his controversial ‘War on Drugs’, which has claimed some 2,400 lives since Duterte came to power. Ban Ki-moon requested to meet Duterte during a summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Laos next week, but the president’s office said it could not happen due to scheduling conflict, Reuters reported. for a leader to be too busy to meet the secretary-general. “his own reasons for not meeting up with some leaders,” but would not elaborate. Duterte’s tough and controversial methods of cracking down on narcotic trade stem from his 22 years as mayor of the City of Davao, which earned him nickname ‘the Punisher’ – after the vigilante anti-hero character of Marvel comics books. Last week UN experts criticized the Philippines for a wave of extrajudicial executions and killings amid the president’s War on Drugs, which was a key point of his electoral platform. The president responded by calling the UN “silly” and threatening to withdraw the Philippines from it, a statement that was later retracted by his Foreign Ministry. An estimated 2,400 deaths related to the war on drugs happened in the country since May, when Duterte was inaugurated as the Philippines’ new president, according to police reports. The youngest person on the list was a five-year-old girl, who was killed during a police raid in the city of Dagupan, located north of the capital, Manila. The anti-drug campaign extends beyond targeting drug dealers and abusers. The Philippines government announced this week that starting next year it would introduce mandatory drug test for all college students. The measure has been in place for the past five years in colleges run by STI College, which has more than 103,000 students this academic year. “It is something that we should be doing because the drug menace is real,” STI’s president, Monico Jacob, told Reuters. The Philippines has long been a key US ally in East Asia and part of Washington’s strategy to oppose China’s growing regional power. Duterte’s first month in power were marred by his insulting of the US Ambassador Philip Goldberg, whom he called a “gay son of whore” for allegedly interfering with the May presidential election. Unlike Ban, US President Barack Obama will meet his Filipino counterpart in Laos, but the talk may be a challenge for him if Obama chooses to discuss human rights. Duterte this week said the American president would have to first listen to him and understand the situation in his country. The White House said Obama would not pull any punches regarding human rights. Duterte also accused the US and Britain of importing terrorism into the Middle East and “destroying” the region.

Spiritual/Moral Cafe/Recipes by Rev. Fr. V.V. Paulose, Toronto, Canada Today's Bible Verse "If you can’t be trusted with worldly riches,  then who will trust you with true riches." (Luke 6 :10) happiness. Is this true in your life? Our integrity is often put on the side in money matters. God calls us to be  honest even in small details; things we could easily ignore. Heaven's riches are  far more valuable than earthly wealth. Money can easily take God's place in your life. It can become your master. Money  is a hard and deceptive master. It promises power, happiness and control, but it  can't deliver these. No amount of money can provide health, happiness, or  eternal life. How much better it is to let God be your master. His servants have  peace of mind and security, both now and forever. We live in an age that measures people's worth by how much money they make. God  spirituality. Though prosperity may earn people's praise, it must never  substitute for devotion and service to God. Money may make a man happy with more  comforts but it cannot increase or make an unhappy man happy. Thalkalai is the erstwhile capital of the Raja of Travancore, located in Tamil  Nadu, India. The king's palace is now a museum. We can see the King’s throne  placed on top of the treasury and the king used to sit on it. The king did it so  kingdom but the king. Money was tight for John Wesley in 1700's. He had to budget to survive. With $40  as his income in an year, he managed to live with it and also set aside $4 to  give away to the needy. When his income increased to $2000 per year, he still  held his budget and lived on $40. He gave the rest of the money to people who  needed it or to charities that would help to tell others about God's love for  them. How could John Wesley do this? All we do know is that at an early age John  decided to make sure that money would be a servant, not his master. "The thing  you should want most is God’s kingdom and doing what God wants. Then all these  other things you need will be given to you" (Mathew 6:33). Jesus, let us seek thy kingdom first. Let a  generation spring out who are honest in all matters of life, especially in  money. Let us understand that we cannot serve money and God at the same time.  Wean away those who are unhappy with piles of their wealth. Let the rich be  gracious to the needy. Let us learn to live with the bare minimum. May pomp and  show be cut off from our lives. May all the genuine needs of people be met. All  we ask in the name of Jesus. Amen. | | | | | | | | Malankara World -  | ------- A service of St. Basil's Syriac Orthodox  Church, Ohio Copyright © 2009-2018 - ICBS Group. All Rights Reserved.

Date: 04:05:21 on Saturday, March 11, 2017 Name: Subject: Re: Try software approach first Well, just one of many general modes of attack, which certainly lays no claim on any conclusive diagnosis or remedy. Have to admit my head is almost spinning from all the detail. I definitely don't have the benefit or advantage of seeing it first hand. Laptops to me are almost in the realm of the movie "Fantastic Voyage" with all the tiny micro delicate parts. I've worked a few, but compared to desktops, some of it may as well be micro-surgery. You've raised some very important awareness regarding the working lifespan of thermal compound. That's something I just haven't happened to run into as an issue yet, either hobbying or professionally; most PCs I've run across- people usually don't keep them long enough for that to be an issue. Guess that might be something to consider in general maintenance, kinda like regular oil changes, particularly with older machines. But I'm glad to hear you've slayed one major dragon; hope all the rest goes well. [an error occurred while processing this directive] E-Mail *

She wanted a Metropolitan Bakery croissant but she also fell in love with the locally made chocolates.  I was glad to combine them into one painting, especially after she dropped off a couple boxes of chocolates made by Eclat and John & Kira's.  My job is quite satisfying.

The Official Website of the Moscone Expansion & Improvements CONTACT+SUPPORT NEWS + INFO Stay Informed! Welcome to Moscone Expansion Project website.  If you would like to receive the monthly newsletter, please sign up below. I support the Moscone Expansion & Improvements An Iconic City. An Iconic Project. A World Class Experience. The Moscone Expansion project is an extraordinary effort by the City, the San Francisco Tourism Improvement District Management Corporation, and the hotel industry to expand our existing convention space. While it is one of the most successful convention centers in the United States, Moscone Center is operating at capacity and is losing business to competing markets with more space to offer. In order to continue to attract the best and brightest events to San Francisco's convention market, we plan to increase our capacity and contiguous space. Tourism is the single biggest contributor to San Francisco's economy and Moscone Center is responsible for 21% of it. This project serves to safeguard the myriad of benefits brought to line-service employees, San Franciscans, and our city at large by guaranteeing our ability to meet demand for years to come. The increases in hotel tax revenue, job creation, and the general positive economic impact of this project will serve the needs of all San Franciscans and visitors alike. To keep up with current construction activities, please . The proposed project site includes a limited portion of Moscone North and Moscone South, with approximately half of the work being done underground in order to better connect the two buildings. No work will take place at Moscone West or east of Third Street. Meetings & Events Click to download a copy of the presentation from the meeting.

, Priyanka in Barfi! : Vidya Balan Mid-Day.com | February 04, 2013 12:32 IST ( ) Vidya Balan is back to work, finishing her schedule for Rajkumar Gupta's next film and now waiting to start work on her film with Farhan Akhtar. Right after tying the knot with Siddharth Roy Kapur, Vidya Balan took her customary days off to soak in the wedded bliss. But like every professional, Vidya is back to work, finishing her schedule for Rajkumar Gupta's next and now waiting to start work on her film with Farhan Akhtar. All this while scooping up several awards for her last release . Ques: Do you feel awards increase expectations and responsibility? Vidya: No, I treat every film differently and every performance is different for me. Though I want all of them to do well. It is like selecting your best eye. You ask yourself which one is more beautiful? I fortunately got to work with good directors and found memorable roles. It is a very special feeling to receive appreciation for what you have done and go back home with trophies in your hands. Ques: Apart from you, which other actress' work did you appreciate last year? Vidya: Undoubtedly Sridevi! It was an honour for me to get nominated along with her. In fact I loved Priyanka Chopra too in Barfi! . I think she was unbelievable in the film and I just adored her. Hope God blesses her. As far as Sridevi is concerned, I have been her fan since . She is a versatile actress. She lights up every frame with her aura. I really don't know how she manages to do that. Ques: You have done one more film with Emraan Hashmi. Post , have the equations between you two changed? Vidya: During our first film we barely spoke to each other as we had very few scenes together. However in the second film we got a chance to interact a lot. He doesn't talk a lot on the sets but this time it was different. He is very professional while working. Emraan has got some brilliant performance-oriented sequences in the film and he was simply remarkable. Ques: ? Vidya: Rajkumar has proven himself in his first film itself. He is young and energetic. He convinced me that I should try comedy as a genre, as he was very confident of me pulling it off. Since I have worked with him before, I naturally share a comfort level with him. He has his own way of presenting strong female characters on screen and I like that a lot. I love his passion and the way he makes the environment light on the sets, even if he is completely charged about doing the shoot. Ques: go on the floors? Vidya: I am really thrilled about it. We all know how the first film happened. When we started the project it was only Sujoy Ghosh (director) and I. Sujoy put together the entire crew and we looked so hard for distributors and all. It was a very different journey and overwhelming experience. He has a very diverse way of thinking. I am waiting to read the script as soon as he completes writing it. Ques: Is Amitabh Bachchan a part of the film? Vidya: I am not aware if he is part of it but I really hope and wish that he is. Don 3 Is Not Very Far.

Metastatic carcinoma of the bladder and bowel obstruction. (Medical Transcription Sample Report) 1.  Metastatic carcinoma of the bladder. 2.  Bowel obstruction. 1.  Metastatic carcinoma of the bladder. 2.  Bowel obstruction. PROCEDURE: Port insertion through the right subclavian vein percutaneously under radiological guidance. PROCEDURE DETAIL: The patient was electively taken to the operating room after obtaining an informed consent.  A time-out process was followed.  Antibiotics were given.  Then, the patient's right deltopectoral area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  Xylocaine 1% was infiltrated.  The right subclavian vein was percutaneously cannulated without any difficulty.  Then using the Seldinger technique, the catheter part of the port, which was a single-lumen port, was passed through the introducer under x-ray guidance and placed in the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium. A pocket had been fashioned and a single-lumen drum of the port was connected to the catheter, which had been trimmed and affixed to the pectoralis fascia with couple of sutures of Vicryl.  Then, the fascia was closed using subcuticular suture of Monocryl.  The drum was aspirated and irrigated with heparinized saline and then was put in the pocket and the skin was closed.  A dressing was applied including the needle and the port with the catheter so that the floor could use the catheter right away. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in satisfactory condition.  A chest x-ray was performed that showed that there were no complications of procedure and that the catheter was in right place.

Nova Gorica, 18.07.2011 Po uvodni tekmi sezone 2011/12 v Prvi ligi ne moremo skriti razočaranja nad dogajanjem v Ljudskem vrtu. Zmotila sta nas predvsem neenoten kriterij pri dosojanju prekrškov in kazni (rumenih kartonov) in delegiranje sodnikov, odločitve, ki so neprijetno zaznamovale prvi letošnji prvoligaški dvoboj. Ta bi se namreč ob dejstvu, da sta se udarili dve doslej najtrofejnejši slovenski ekipi, lahko izkazal za odlično nogometno predstavo, po kateri pa v Novi Gorici ne moremo mimo neprijetnega občutka, da smo bili oškodovani. Zato: - Zvezo nogometnih sodnikov Slovenije prosimo za javno objavo njihove strokovne ocene sojenja tekme v Mariboru in to ne le nekaterih najvidnejših, po našem mnenju spornih odločitev (11-m za Maribor, nekaznovano igranje z roko Vidoviča v kazenskem prostoru Maribora na začetku tekme, neenoten kriterij pri podeljevanju kartonov: igralce Maribora je sodnik ob dosojanju prekrškov opominjal le besedno, medtem ko je igralcem Gorice za take prekrške podeljeval kartone), itd. Prosimo tudi, da po objavi ocene sojenja tekme ZNSS objavi tudi ukrepe, s katerimi bo sankcionirala sodnike, saj so ukrepi za  igralce in strokovna vodstva ekip javno znani in objavljeni. Edino primerno je, da se na tak način objavlja tudi ukrepe proti sodnikom. - v oči bode tudi dejstvo, da so bili za to tekmo delegirani štajerski sodniki. Loče pri Poljčanah, Apače in Zgornja Ložnica so od Maribora le nekaj kilometrov oddaljeni kraji, ki nakazujejo na vse preveč očiten (beri: pristranski) izbor delivcev pravice. Združenje prvoligašev Slovenije prosimo, da poda obrazložitev omenjenega delegiranja, ki je v razmerah, ki so jih nekateri ustvarili že pred pričetkom prvenstva 2011/12, popolnoma neprimerno. Menimo tudi, da je besedna vojna, ki so jo nekateri zanetili že pred začetkom prvenstva, dosegla svoj namen, to je vršila in izvršila pritisk na sodnike, če ne tudi na sodniško organizacijo, od katere pričakujemo, da odslej ne bo več nasedala ustrahovanjem in se bo držala tega, kar je tudi sama zapisala v izjavi za javnost pred dnevi: da so merila za vse enaka. Upamo, da se bo to v nadaljevanju sezone tudi dejansko zgodilo, saj na tekmi v Mariboru temu ni bilo tako! K treznemu premisleku zato ob tej priložnosti pozivamo vse akterje dogajanja v slovenskem nogometu, tj. Zvezo nogometnih sodnikov Slovenije, Združenje prvoligašev Slovenije, Nogometno zvezo Slovenije in prvoligaške nogometne klube, k objektivnejšemu in uravnoteženemu poročanju o vseh in ne le o t.i. »velikih« klubih pa vse slovenske medije. 19.04.2018 Trener Srebrnič: vse nam gre narobe; na voljo je še 27 točk 18.04.2018 Iz Krškega praznih rok, že v soboto nova priložnost 18.04.2018 18.04.2018 15.04.2018 Nogometno društvo Gorica (ND Gorica) The beginnings go back to the year 1947 when, right after the Annexation of the Primorska region to the native land of Slovenia (Paris Peace Treaties, 10. 2. 1947), the clubs of the neighbouring villages Bilje, Miren and Šempeter joined into the athletic society Telovadno društvo Gorica. They played on the football field located behind the Šempeter Hospital. In Solkan, too was a club - the origins of which go back to the year 1918 with the foundation of the Volga Club - which developed football parallelly to the one in Šempeter. After the Second World War it changed its name into the football club NK Branik. The first visible success of the new club in Šempeter originated in the season 1954/1955 when the sports association then called ŽŠD Nova Gorica became Slovenian Champion for the first time. It qualified itself for the Second Yugoslav Federal Division. The competitive strategy at that time was in general rather complicated, the names and the division systems changed from season to season. An important turning point experienced the club in 1963 with the move from Šempeter to Nova Gorica – to the stadium Sports Park which, however, wasn’t yet completed. At the same time the Šempeter club merged with the club Branik from Solkan and got the name: Football club Nova Gorica. The team from the Goriška region was – except for two short-lasting periods of time when it played in the Division II - up to the declaration of Independence of Slovenia in 1991 member of the Slovenian First Division. The Vozila club, named thus in the period between 1971 and 1991, achieved its best results in the season 1968/69 when it was second and in the season 1987/88 when it came third. With the Declaration of Independence in the year 1991 the Slovenian football experienced its greatest decisive moment. The National Football Association of Slovenia (NZS) and the clubs had on the one hand a brighter future ahead of them but on the other also a more uncertain one. The Gorica club, sponsored from 1993 to 2012 by the local gaming and tourist company Hit d. d., achieved its first sensational classification – the third place - in the season 1994/95. Already the very next season the football fans in the Goriška region could rejoice for the first time the title of Slovenian National Champion. In Nova Gorica that season, also for the first time, they played in the UEFA Cup. 2001, 2002 In the following four years the club was always classified almost at the top of the scale - twice it came second and three times third. In the years between 2001 and 2002 the Club HIT Gorica was champion of the Slovenian Cup. 2004, 2005, 2006 - THREE SLOVENIAN The result of the reorganization of the whole operating of the football collective and the orientation towards football players who are instructed and coached at home, was in the year 2004 the second Slovenian National Champion title. After that Gorica achieved also the best classification in the European Cups. In the Champions League qualifications, in the second round, they beat the Danish champion FC Kopenhagen 5-0 and competed for the entrance in the Champions League with Monaco which was better. In the years between 2005 and 2006 Nova Gorica rejoiced two more Slovenian National Champion titles. The season 2006/07, however, they closed on the second place, the season 2207/2008 ended as third, and in the season 2008/09 in the second place. 2009-2013 In the season 2009/2010 ND Gorica finished on the third place, on the year later on 5th place. In the season 2011/12 the white-blues closed on the 5th place also, and in the season 2012/13 of First Slovenian football league finished on the 6th place. 2014 - THE THIRD CUP TROPHY The season 2013/14 ND Gorica started with almost new team with lots of new players. On the competition Prva liga (Slovenian First division) ended in 4th place, but the club reached the final in Slovenian Cup. ND Gorica won the final game on 21th of May 2014 at Bonifika stadium in Koper against NK Maribor. This is the 8th trophy for the club, the first since 2006. After three years ND Gorica also qualified on European clubs competitions.
